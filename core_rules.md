# Riftbound Core Rules

### Last Updated: 2025-10-

## 000. Golden and Silver Rules

### 001. Golden Rule

002. Card text supersedes rules text. Whenever a card fundamentally contradicts the rules, the card's indication is
    what is true.

### 050. Silver Rule

051. Card text uses different terminology than rules. Card text should be interpreted according to these rules, not as
    though it were text within these rules.
052. **Card** , when written in card effects, is shorthand for " **Main Deck** card." Runes, legends, and battlefields are _not_
    considered cards when executing the abilities and effects of game objects. They are considered cards for the
    purposes of these rules.
053. Cards refer to themselves in the first person.
053.1. * Units and legends say "I," "me," etc.
053.2. * Gear and spells say "this."
053.3. * Battlefields say "here."
054. “Can’t beats Can”
054.1. Cards that forbid actions or effects, as a broad method of determination, supersede cards that allow or
    permit that same action or effect.
055. When executing card text, do as much as you can, ignoring impossible instructions.
055.1. If all of a card’s instructions are impossible, it is still played and resolved, but nothing happens.

## 100. Game Concepts

### 101. Deck Construction

102. _Riftbound_ is a Trading Card Game where a player must provide their own cards to play against other players.
103. To play _Riftbound_ , a player must have two **Decks,** a **Champion Legend** , and a number of **Battlefields**
    determined by the **Mode of Play.**
103.1. 1 **Champion Legend**
103.1.a. This is placed in the **Legend Zone** at the start of the game.
103.1.b. This will dictate the **Domain Identity** of the **Main Deck.**
103.1.b.1. Cards included in your **Deck** must abide by your **Domain Identity.**
103.1.b.2. Your deck’s **Domain Identity** is dictated by the domains of your **Champion Legend.**
    In the default card frame, these domains appear as symbols in the legend’s upper
    left corner.
103.1.b.3. If a card has a single **Domain** , then that card is permitted in the **Domain Identity**
    that corresponds to the same **Domain.**


103.1.b.4. If a card has more than one **Domain** , then that card is permitted _only_ in a **Domain
Identity** that contains all of the indicated **Domains** on that card.
103.2. **A Main Deck of at least 40 cards** 1 Chosen Champion Unit Units Gear Spells
103.2.a. **Chosen Champion**
103.2.a.1. This will be placed in the **Champion Zone** at the start of the game.
103.2.a.2. Must be a champion unit with a champion tag that matches the tag on your
**Champion Legend.** _Example:_ Loose Cannon has the tag _Jinx_. Therefore, a player
could choose Jinx, Rebel or Jinx, Demolitionist as their **Chosen Champion** , because
they also have the tag _Jinx_. _Example:_ Tibbers has the tag _Annie_ , but it is a signature
unit, not a champion unit. It cannot be your **Chosen Champion** , even if your
**Champion Legend** has the tag _Annie_.
103.2.a.3. A player’s **Chosen Champion** is both the specific card chosen for this slot during
Deck Building and also any **Champion Unit** with the same name as the specific
card selected for this specific slot during the course of play. _Example:_ A player
chose Jinx, Rebel as their Chosen Champion. One copy of Jinx, Rebel starts the
game in their Chosen Champion zone. Any additional copies of Jinx, Rebel in their
Main Deck, their hand, their trash, or on the board also count as their Chosen
Champion for any game rules and effects that care about Chosen Champion status
during the game.
103.2.b. Your **Main Deck** can include up to 3 copies of the same named card.
103.2.b.1. This includes your **Chosen Champion.** _Example:_ A deck could include Volibear,
Furious as its **Chosen Champion** and still include 2 more copies of Volibear, Furious.
103.2.b.2. Cards have different names even if they represent the same character. _Example:_ A
deck could include 3 copies of Yasuo, Remorseful and 3 copies of Yasuo, Windrider,
because they have different names.
103.2.c. Subject to **Domain Identity.**
103.2.d. Your deck may only contain 3 _total_ **Signature** cards that have the same Champion tag as
your **Champion Legend.**
103.2.d.1. Regardless of name, a deck may only contain a sum total of 3 Signature cards.
103.2.d.2. All of the Signature cards must have the Champion tag that corresponds to the
**Champion Legend** of the deck.
103.2.d.3. Signature cards are not Champion units and cannot be placed in the **Champion
Zone**.
103.2.e. During Gameplay, the **Main Deck** is **Secret Information.**
103.2.e.1. It cannot be looked through or revealed unless instructed by a card effect.
103.3. **Rune Deck**
103.3.a. 12 **Rune Cards**
103.3.a.1. Cards in this deck must be of the **Domain Identity** of your **Champion Legend.**
103.3.b. Must be shuffled and kept separate from the **Main Deck.**
103.4. **Battlefields**
103.4.a. The number will be dictated by your **Mode of Play.**
103.4.b. Subject to **Domain Identity** if applicable.


103.4.c. Cannot include more than one of a **Battlefield** of the same name when there are more than
one required for the deck.

### 124. Cards

125. _Riftbound_ games are composed of players playing the cards in their respective decks.
126. **Ownership**
126.1. For gameplay purposes, a card's **Owner** is the player who brought it into the game, either as their
    **Champion Legend** , one of their **Battlefields** , or part of their **Main Deck** or **Rune Deck**. The legal
    owner of a card doesn't matter during gameplay.
       _Example:_ Bo didn't bring a deck, so Alice loans him a deck. During the game, Bo is
       considered the owner of those cards, even though legally they belong to Alice.
127. **Privacy**
127.1. A card will always exist in one of the many **Zones** described during **Setup.**
127.2. A card will have a different level of **Privacy** based on where it resides at a given time
127.3. **Secret:** This level of Privacy indicates that neither player may read or look at the face of the card.


127.4. **Private:** This level of Privacy indicates that only the controller of a card on the board or the owner of a
card in any other zone may read or look at the face of the card.
_Example:_ Cards in a player's hand are owned by that player. Only that player may read or
look at their faces.
_Example:_ If a player controls a facedown card at a battlefield, that player and only that player
may read or look at that card's face, regardless of who owns that card.
127.5. **Public:** This level of Privacy indicates that any player may read or look at the face of the card.

128. **Back Side**
128.1. The back side of a card is the side with the **Riftbound** logo.
128.2. There is a unique pattern of back side for each of the three categories of card: **Main Deck** cards, **Rune**
    **Deck** cards, and **Battlefields** and **Champion Legends.**
128.3. The back side of a card is presented to conceal information for **Private** and **Secret** information cards.
    For example, cards in the **Main Deck** and cards in hand have their back side presented.
128.4. The term **facedown** is used to describe the state during regular play of having a card's back side
    presented on the Board. A facedown card’s front side is considered **Private Information.**
129. **Front Side**
129.1. The front side of a card is the opposite of its back.
129.2. This is also referred to as a **front face.**
129.3. This can be identified in situations where the back is not easily discernible by the presence of the **Play**
    **Cost** in the upper left corner of the card.
129.4. Cards, when played, are played with their front face presented.
129.5. The term **face up** is used to describe the state during regular play of having a card's front face
    presented
129.6. Cards are considered to be **Public Information** while in this state, even if obscured by other cards in a
    pile. _Example:_ The Trash is **Public Information** because all cards there have their front face presented
    even while stacked.
130. **Cost**
130.1. **Main Deck** cards have a **Cost** , listed in the upper left corner of the front face of the card.
    _See_ **_rule 158. Rune Pools_** _for more information._
130.2. **Energy** Cost
130.2.a. The numeral listed in the **Cost** element in the upper left corner of the card.
130.3. **Power** cost
130.3.a. The symbols, listed vertically, in the **Cost** element in the upper left corner of the card.
130.3.b. This section may not be present on every card.
130.4 Effects that need to determine a card’s cost for any purpose always use its base cost, even if that cost
    is altered or ignored as the card is played.
       _Example:_ Sky Splitter is a spell that costs 8 Energy and says in part “This spell's Energy cost is
       reduced by the highest Might among units you control.” Lux, Illuminated is a unit that says
       “When you play a spell that costs 5 or more, give me +3 [M] this turn.” If a player who controls
       Lux plays Sky Splitter, Lux’s ability will trigger, regardless of how much was actually paid for
       Sky Splitter.


131. **Name**
131.1. Each card has a name that identifies it uniquely.
131.2. This is usually located in the middle of the card.
131.3. Cards that are printed in different languages but represent the same card are considered to have the
    same name for the purposes of deckbuilding and gameplay.
       _Example:_ Chemtech Enforcer in English and its counterpart in Chinese are considered the
       same card, despite the **Name** element on the card reading differently.
131.4 Some cards have both a short name and a subtitle. For all purposes, including rules and deckbuilding,
    such a card’s name is “[Short Name], [Subtitle]”. _Example:_ Kai’Sa, Evolutionary and Kai’Sa, Survivor
    both have the short name Kai’Sa, but they have different names. You can include 3 of each in your
    deck under normal deckbuilding rules. If one of them is your Chosen Champion, the other is not.
132. **Category**
132.1. A card can have one or more **Categories** and **Sub-Categories** based on the properties of its front and
    back sides.
132.2. These **Categories** and **Sub-Categories** dictate the behaviors of the card during play.
132.3. Spells and other effects can refer to categories, sub-categories, supertypes, card types, tags, and other
    characteristics inclusively or exclusively.
       _Example:_ A "non-unit card" is any card that is not a unit.
       _Example:_ A "unit" is any game object that is a unit, regardless of any other categories it
       belongs to.
132.4. **Main Deck Cards** begin the game in the **Main Deck** or (in the case of a **Chosen Champion** ) the
    **Champion Zone.**
132.4.a. **Permanents**
132.4.a.1. An umbrella sub-category encompassing **Main Deck** Game Objects that remain on
    the board after being played.
132.4.a.2. **Unit** and **Gear** are permanent types.
132.4.b. **Spells**
132.4.b.1. A sub-category encompassing Main Deck cards with the spell type, which do not
    remain on the board after being played.
132.5. **Rune Deck Cards** begin the game in the **Rune Deck.**
132.5.a. **Runes**
132.5.a.1. A sub-category encompassing cards with the rune type. These are **channeled**
    rather than played. They remain on the board after being channeled, but they are
    _not_ permanents, as they are not **Main Deck** cards.
132.6. **Non-Deck Cards** are not part of any deck and begin the game in a zone determined by their type.
132.6.a. **Battlefields**
132.6.a.1. A sub-category encompassing cards with the battlefield type. They are not played
    or channeled. They start the game on the board.
132.6.b. **Legends**
132.6.b.1. A sub-category encompassing cards with the legend type. They are not played or
    channeled. They start the game in the Legend Zone and cannot leave it during play.


132.7. **Supertypes** are **Categories** that may apply to game objects of multiple types. They are listed before a
card’s type.
132.7.a. **Champion** is a supertype that applies exclusively to units. It impacts the rules for
deckbuilding.
_See_ **_rule 103.2.a. Chosen Champion_** _for more information._
132.7.b. **Signature** is a supertype that may apply to game objects of any card type. It impacts the
rules for deckbuilding.

133.1. Most cards belong to one or more of six **Domains** , identified by one or more symbols in the lower
    right corner.

134. **Rules Text**
134.1. All cards have a section that describes how they affect the game. This section is known as the **Rules**
    **Text** of the card.
134.2. This section may contain:
134.2.a. **Abilities**
134.2.a.1. Abilities are discrete pieces of text that describe what a card may or must do.
    _See_ **_rule 357. Abilities_** _for more information._
134.2.a.2. They may appear on any card.
134.2.b. **Instructions**

function.
134.2.e. **Symbols**
134.2.e.1. Rules text sometimes contains symbols that express game concepts. Each symbol
also has a shorthand used to represent it in written text.
134.2.e.2. The cost of **Exhausting** a **Permanent** is represented by the “exhaust symbol,” which

symbol, but appears in these rules similarly to other symbols. Its shorthand is [C].
134.2.e.6.a. When a [C] shorthand is printed on a card as reminder text, it assumes
that card’s usual **Domain** , but it still means “one Power of this card’s
**Domain** .”

149. A spell is controlled by the player who played it.
150. A spell creates a game effect according to its instructions and is then placed in the **Trash** of the player who
    owns it.
151. When a spell is successfully played, a player executes the rules text of the spell. This is called **Resolving** the
    spell.
151.1. Spells have their rules text executed from top to bottom when they are **Resolved.**
151.2. If a later part of a spell applies a **Replacement Effect** that alters earlier parts of the spell, apply those
    replacement effects as appropriate. _Example:_ A spell says "Choose a unit. Kill it the next time it takes
    damage this turn." and "[Legion] — Kill it now instead. _(Get the effect if you've played another card_
    _this turn.)_ " If the Legion condition is satisfied, the unit is killed immediately and the instruction to kill
    it the next time it takes damage is ignored, even if the unit remains on the board somehow.
151.3. While a spell or ability on the chain is **Resolving** , no other spells or abilities can be finalized on the
    chain or resolved, including triggered abilities or game effects that would occur as a result of the
    execution of the spell.
151.3.a. Finish resolving _all effects_ of a spell before addressing anything the spell may have triggered
    or caused through execution.
152. Certain **Keywords** on spells are not executable rules text, but instead intrinsic properties of the spell.
152.1. These determine inherent properties and behaviors of the spell before being played or while on the
    chain.
152.2. These keywords are:
152.2.a. **Action**
152.2.a.1. This indicates that, in addition to being able to be played during an **Open State** ,
    this spell may _also_ be played during **Open States** during **Showdowns.**
152.2.b. **Reaction**
152.2.b.1. Grants all cases and rules of **Action.**
152.2.b.2. In addition to all prior cases, may _also_ be played during **all forms of Closed State.**
152.2.b.3. This will result in this spell resolving before spells and abilities that are already on
    the chain.

### 153. Runes

154. **Rune** is a **Card Type.**
154.1. A **Rune** is not a **Main Deck** card.

156.1.a. **Energy** has no Domain.
156.1.b. **Energy** has no type.
156.2. **Power** is used to pay Domain-associated **Power Costs.**

    **Recycled.**
158. Rune Pools
159. The **Rune Pool** is a conceptual collection of a player's available **Energy** and **Power** available to pay **Costs.**
159.1. When a card adds **Energy** or **Power,** it is added to the controlling player's **Rune Pool**.
159.2. Players must first add **Energy** and **Power** to their **Rune Pool** in order to be able to spend it to play
    cards or pay for **Abilities** with costs.
159.3. **Energy** and **Power** do not have a physical marker or tracker, although players may wish to use a
    physical tracker if they are retaining unspent **Energy** and **Power** over the course of their turn.

171. **Tokens** are **Game Objects** created by spells and abilities during play.
172. Tokens can be represented by anything. Printed tokens are included in **Riftbound** booster packs, but they are
    not required to play a token.
173. A token's **controller** is the controller of the spell or ability that created it, unless the token's type innately
    determines control or that spell or ability specifies that a different player is the token's controller.
174. A token's **owner** is the player who controlled the effect that created it.
175. The effect that creates a token may specify the conditions or circumstances under which it enters the board.
    These stipulations may alter the usual steps for playing a card.
175.1. The effect may state that the token enters ready or exhausted, if that state is contrary to the default
    for the token's type.
175.2. The effect may restrict the location to which the token may be played.
175.3. The effect may grant temporary abilities or modifications to the token.

_See_ **_rule 732. Temporary_** _for more information._

### 179. Control

180. **Control** is the concept of a player having influence of a **Game Object** and applies differently to different card
    types.
181. **Battlefields**
181.1. **Control** is established over **Battlefields** through the course of play.
181.2. **Control** is a binary state for **Battlefields** and an **Identifier** for players.
181.2.a. A **Battlefield** is **Controlled** or **Uncontrolled.**
181.2.b. A **Battlefield** is **Controlled by a specific player** or **Controlled by no one.**
181.3. **Control** can be **Contested** through the course of play.
181.3.a. **Contested** is a temporary status applied to the battlefield when a **Unit** controlled by a **Player**
    who does not currently **Control** that **Battlefield Moves** or otherwise becomes present there.
181.3.a.1. **Units** moving to or being played to a battlefield apply Contested status if that
    battlefield is not already contested and that **Unit** ’s controller does not already
    control that battlefield.
181.3.b. A **Battlefield** remains **Contested** until **Control** is established or re-established.
181.3.c. While a **Battlefield** remains **Contested, Control** of a **Battlefield** cannot change.
181.3.d. The state of a **Battlefield** being **Contested** is used to determine when **Combat** should occur,
    when a **Showdown** without a **Combat** should occur, and when **Control** will change.
181.3.e. At this time **Game Effects** cannot reference this status.
181.4. **Control** is established by having **Units** at a **Battlefield** at the end of a Showdown or Combat after
    applying the contested status.
181.4.a. If a player controls **Units** at a **Battlefield,** outside of **Combat** , they maintain **Control** of that
    **Battlefield** for as long as they have **Units** at that **Battlefield.**
181.4.b. A player maintains control of a **Battlefield** while it is being **Contested** by an opponent.
181.4.c. If a player has no **Units** at a **Battlefield,** they lose **Control** of that **Battlefield** immediately,
    unless it is **Contested.**
181.5. **Control** is a constant state.
181.6. **Control** of a **Battlefield** determines **Control** of its **Abilities.**
181.6.a. While a **Battlefield** is **Controlled** , its **Controller** controls its **Abilities**. That player takes
    responsibility for adding them to the **Chain** if applicable, and makes all choices required by
    them unless otherwise specified.


181.6.b. While a **Battlefield** is **Uncontrolled** , its **Abilities** are also **Uncontrolled.** The **Turn Player**
takes responsibility for adding them to the **Chain** if applicable, makes all choices required by
them unless otherwise specified, and is treated as their **Controller** if any game rule or effect
requires one. _Example:_ The Arena’s Greatest is a battlefield that reads “At the start of each
player's first Beginning Phase, that player gains 1 point.” This ability will usually trigger while
the battlefield has no controller. If it does, the Turn Player goes through the steps of adding
the ability to the chain and receives priority after doing so, exactly as if they controlled the
ability.
181.6.c. “You” in a battlefield’s abilities refers to the battlefield’s **Controller** , as does the implied “you”
in instructions like “draw 1.” If the battlefield has no **Controller** , “you” refers to no one, and all
such instructions are ignored.

182. **Everything Else**
182.1. When a player **Plays** a **Card** , they are established as that **Game Object's Controller.**
182.2. For **Spells** , they are the **Spell's Controller.**
182.2.a. That player chooses targets.
182.2.b. That player chooses modes.
182.2.c. That player pays costs.
182.3. For **Permanents** and **Runes** , when they **Enter the Board** , that player is assigned as that **Game**
    **Object's Controller.**
182.3.a. That player may make decisions about the **Game Object's Inherent Abilities.**
182.3.b. That player may make decisions about the **Game Object's Unique Abilities.**
182.3.c. That player may make decisions about any game effects or decisions necessary while the
    card is being played.
182.3.d. That player may make decisions about any game effects created from "When you play me"
    effects of **Permanents.**
183. When a game effect or rules text refers to the **Controller** of a specific object, it can be referring to either
    context interchangeably.
183.1. The method of assignment of control is different, but the status of **Control** is the same across all
    **Game Objects.**

## 300. Playing the Game

### 301. The Turn

302. Play continues cyclically until one player wins.
303. The phases of a turn are rigid, but the actions taken during those steps can be done in any order, unless
    otherwise specified.
303.1. **Game Actions** of any nature are performed one at a time and are executed completely.
303.2. **Game Actions** cannot be performed simultaneously for any reason.
303.2.a. If one or more actions, game effects, or **Triggered Abilities** are activated simultaneously,
    then **Turn Order** is referenced to organize the sequence of actions.
       _See_ **_rule 375. Triggered Abilities_** _for more information._
304. The **Turn Player** is the player taking the current turn.


305. When there are no items on the **Chain** and the **Turn Player** cannot or chooses not to perform any
    **Discretionary Actions** , the current phase or step of the turn ends and the next phase, step, or turn begins.
306. The **Turn Player** changes when the current **Turn Player** reaches the **End** of all of the **Phases** of their **Turn.**
307. States of the Turn
308. At any given time, the turn is in either a **Neutral State** or a **Showdown State.**
308.1. If a **Showdown** is in progress, the turn is in a **Showdown State.**
308.1.a. Only cards and abilities with the **Action** or **Reaction** keywords can be played or activated in
    a **Showdown State.**
308.2. If no **Showdown** is in progress, the turn is in a **Neutral State.**

309.1. If a **Chain** exists, the turn is in a **Closed State.**
309.1.a. Only cards and abilities with the **Reaction** keyword can be played or activated in a **Closed**
    **State.**
309.2. If no **Chain** exists, the turn is in an **Open State.**
310. These descriptions can be combined, such that the turn is always in one of these four states:
310.1. **Neutral Open:** There is no **Showdown** in progress and no **Chain** exists.
310.1.a. By default, cards can be played and abilities activated only when a player has priority on their
    turn in a **Neutral Open** state.
310.2. **Neutral Closed:** There is no **Showdown** in progress and a **Chain** exists.
310.3. **Showdown Open:** A **Showdown** is in progress and no **Chain** exists.
310.4. **Showdown Closed:** A **Showdown** is in progress and a **Chain** exists.
311. Priority and Focus
312. At any given time, up to one player has **Priority.**
312.1. **Priority** is the permission to take **Discretionary Actions.**

320. While a **Cleanup** is occurring, **Chain Items** cannot be **Resolved.**
320.1. New **Pending Items** can be added, but **Legal Items** cannot be executed and **Priority** and **Focus** are
    not passed or awarded.
321. If an event occurs during a **Cleanup** that qualifies for a **Cleanup,** another **Cleanup** will occur immediately after
    the first completes, repeating until a **Cleanup** occurs with no new change in the game’s state.
322. When a **Cleanup** occurs, the following steps occur in order:
322.1. 1. If a player has as many points as the **Victory Score** , that player wins.
322.2. 2. All **Units** that have non-zero **Damage** marked on them equalling or exceeding their **Might** are
    killed and placed in their owners' **Trash.**
322.3. 3. Assign or Remove the **Attacker** or **Defender** designation from **Units** as needed if there is a **Combat**
    in progress
322.3.a. If there are **Units** present at the **Battlefield** the **Combat** is taking place at, but do not have a
    designation, they gain the same designation as their **Controller** now


322.3.b. If there are **Units** present at the **Battlefield** the **Combat** is taking place at, but have the
opposite designation of their controller, they lose that designation, and gain the same
designation as their controller now
322.3.c. If there are **Units** at locations other than the **Battlefield** that the **Combat** is taking place at,
but have either **Attacker** or **Defender** designations, they lose those designations now
322.4. 4. **Battlefields** with no **Units** occupying them and no **Contested** status become **Uncontrolled.**
322.5. 5. Recall all **Gear** at **Battlefields.** Remove all **Hidden** cards from all **Battlefields** that are not controlled

opposing players there.
322.8. 8. **Finalize** any **Pending Items** on the **Chain**

    normal **Cleanup.**
323.1. When a **Special Cleanup** is invoked, the unique steps added will be inserted and defined by the
    sub-section that invokes it.
       _Example:_ When a **Combat Cleanup** is invoked, the **Combat** section defines what steps are
       added to the **Cleanup.**
323.2. If events during a **Special Cleanup require** another **Cleanup,** a normal **Cleanup** is invoked, not
    another iteration of the **Special Cleanup**.

### 324. Chains and Showdowns

325. Players can act during the following **Windows of Opportunity** that occur during the course of regular play:
325.1. During a **Chain**
325.2. During a **Showdown**
326. Chains
327. The **Chain** is a **Non-Board Zone** that temporarily exists whenever a card is played or an ability is activated.
327.1. Cards are placed here as part of the process of being played.
327.2. Abilities are queued here as part of the process of resolving.
    _See_ **_rule 357. Abilities_** _for more information._
328. Cards and abilities added to the chain are added as **Pending Chain Items** that become Finalized **Chain Items.**
328.1. **Pending Items** are on the Chain.
328.2. **Chain Items** are **Pending** until the “Check Legality” step of playing a card.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
328.3. When a **Pending Chain Item** is no longer **Pending** it is finalized and becomes a Finalized **Chain Item**.


329. The **Chain** exists as long as a **Chain Item** is on it.
329.1. Only one **Chain** can exist at a time.
329.2. If a card would begin to be played while a **Chain** already exists, it is placed on the existing **Chain.**
330. The **State** of the **Turn** is partially determined by whether or not the **Chain** currently exists.
330.1. The turn is said to be in a **Closed State** if a **Chain** exists.
330.1.a. Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a **Closed State.**
330.1.b. Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a **Closed State.**
330.2. The turn is said to be in an **Open State** if _no_ **Chain** exists.
331. Steps of Resolving Chain Items
332. Whenever a card or token is played or an ability is activated or triggered, a **Chain** is created.
332.1. The player that created the chain becomes the first **Active Player.**
332.2. The **Active Player** is a designator similar to, but distinct from, **Turn Player.**
332.3. Similar to the **Turn Player** , this designation will pass between players over the course of play.
333. **Step 1: Finalize**
333.1. If one or more Items are **Pending** , their controllers must complete the steps of **Playing** those
    **Pending Items** until they are **Finalized Items** or leave the **Chain.**
333.1.a. This process does not pass **Priority.**
333.1.b. Each Item is **Finalized** in the order it was appended to the **Chain.**
333.1.c. Abilities that **Add** resources, **Units** , and **Gear** resolve immediately when **Finalized** and do not
    progress to Step 2: Execute.
       _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
333.1.c.1. If the **Chain** is empty, play proceeds in an **Open State.**
333.1.c.2. If the **Chain** is not empty and there are one or more **Pending Items** , repeat Step 1.
333.1.c.3. If the **Chain** is not empty and there are no **Pending Items** , the controller of the
    newest item on the chain gains **Priority** and becomes the **Active Player.** Proceed
    to Step 2: Execute.
334. **Step 2: Execute**
334.1. The **Active Player** may do any the following:
334.1.a. **Play** a **Card** that is **legally timed.**
334.1.a.1. **Cards** , by default, cannot be played during a **Closed State.**
334.1.a.2. A **Legally Timed Card** would be a **Card** with **Reaction.**
334.1.a.3. Other exceptions may be created during regular play.
334.1.a.4. The card will be added to the chain as a **Pending Item** , following the steps of
    playing a card.
334.1.a.5. This can be an additional card to the item that **Started** the **Chain** in the case of the
    first **Active Player** after creating the **Chain.**
334.1.a.6. Whether a **Card** is legally timed is evaluated during the “Check Legality” step of


**Playing a Card.**
_See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
334.1.a.7. Playing a card will create one or more **Pending Items**. Return to Step 1: Finalize.
334.1.b. **Activate Abilities** of **Game Objects** that are **legally timed.**
_See_ **_rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities_** _for more information._
334.1.b.1. All rules for **legally timed** cards apply to **legally timed** abilities.
334.1.b.2. Activating abilities will create one or more **Pending Items**. Return to Step 1: Finalize.
334.1.c. **Pass Priority**
334.1.c.1. The **Active Player** passes **Priority** to the next **Player** in **Turn Order.** Proceed to Step
3: Pass.

335. **Step 3: Pass**
335.1. If all players have passed **Priority** without adding any items to the **Chain** , proceed to Step 4: Resolve.
335.2. Otherwise, the **Active Player** passes **Priority** to the next **Player** in **Turn Order.** Return to Step 3:
    Execute.
336. **Step 4: Resolve**
336.1. The newest item on the **Chain** resolves. Execute its game effects in their entirety.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information on resolving spells._
    _See_ **_rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities_** _for more information on resolving abilities._
336.2. If the **Chain** is empty, play proceeds in an **Open State.**
336.3. If the **Chain** is not empty and there are one or more **Pending Items** , return to Step 1: Finalize.
336.4. If the **Chain** is not empty and there are no **Pending Items** , the controller of the newest item on the
    chain gains **Priority** and becomes the **Active Player.** Return to Step 2: Execute.
337. **Showdowns**
338. A **Showdown** is a **Window of Opportunity** in which **Players** have an **Open State** in which they may play
    **Spells** in an alternating fashion.
338.1. Each spell played this way creates a **Chain** as normal.
339. The **State** of the turn is partially determined by whether or not a **Showdown** is in progress.
339.1. The turn is said to be in a **Showdown State** if a **Showdown** is in progress.
339.1.a. Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a **Showdown State.**
339.1.b. Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a **Showdown State.**
339.2. The turn is said to be in a **Neutral State** if no **Showdown** is in progress.
340. A **Showdown** begins when **Control** of a **Battlefield** is **Contested and the turn is in a Neutral Open State.**
340.1. If **Control** of a **Battlefield** is **Contested** between two players, then a **Showdown** will be opened as the
    first step of **Combat.**
       _See_ **_rule 433. Combat_** _for more information._
340.2. If **Control** of a **Battlefield** is **Contested** and the **Battlefield** in question is uncontrolled when it
    becomes **Contested** , a **Showdown** is opened during the **Cleanup** at the end of the action that
    caused the **Battlefield** to become **Contested.**
341. As a **Showdown** begins, the player who applied **Contested** status to the **Battlefield** gains **Focus.**


342. When a **Showdown** begins, it may or may not begin with an **Initial Chain.**
342.1. **Showdowns** that open as a result of **Combat** may have an **Initial Chain** of **Triggered Abilities.**
342.1.a. These **Triggered Abilities** should be put on the chain first by the player with **Focus** , then
    proceeding with players without the Defender designation in **Turn Order.** Finally, the player
    with the **Defender** designation will add their **Triggered Abilities** , if any, to the **Chain.**
342.1.b. If there are no such **Triggered Abilities** present during a **Combat** -initiated **Showdown** then
    no **Initial Chain** is created, but the **Showdown** will still proceed.
343. When the last item on the chain resolves during a **Showdown** , **Focus** passes, and the next **Player** gains both
    **Focus** and **Priority.**
343.1. Focus does not pass when the last item on the Initial Chain resolves, if there was one. Instead the
    player with Focus proceeds with play.
344. During a **Showdown** , the player with **Focus** may do one of the following:
344.1. **Play** a spell that is **legally timed.**
344.1.a. The spell will start a **Chain** as normal.
344.2. **Activate Abilities** of **Game Objects** that are **legally timed.**
    _See_ **_rule 357. Abilities_** _for more information._
344.3. Pass.
344.3.a. If all **Players** have passed once in sequence, the **Showdown** ends.
344.3.a.1. Perform a **Cleanup.**
344.4. Otherwise, **Focus** passes to the next **Player** in **Turn Order.**
345. If all players pass **Focus** without playing a spell or activating an ability, then the **Showdown** Closes.
345.1. If this **Showdown** opened as a result of **Combat,** proceed with the remaining steps of **Combat** to
    resolve the phase.
       _See_ **_rule 437. The Steps of Combat_** _for more information._
345.2. If this **Showdown** opened as a result of **Contested** being applied to a **Battlefield** without a controller,
    do one of the following:
345.2.a. If only one player’s Units remain at the **Battlefield** , and if that player does not already Control
    the **Battlefield** , that player establishes Control over the **Battlefield**.
       _See_ **_rule 179. Control_** _for more information on_ **_Control_**_._
       _See_ **_rule 442.1._** _for more information on_ **_Conquering_**_._
345.2.a.1. This results in a Conquer if that player has not yet scored that **Battlefield** this turn.
345.2.b. If two players’ **Units** remain at the **Battlefield** , **Control** cannot be established and the
    **Battlefield** remains **Contested**. This results in a **Staged Combat**.
       _See_ **_rule 433. Combat_** _for more information._
345.2.b.1. The player who applied **Contested** to the **Battlefield** will be the **Attacker** in the
    subsequent **Combat.**

### 346. Playing Cards

347. Playing a card is the act of a player utilizing their cards.
347.1. A card is **Played** when it has finished this process in its entirety.
347.2. Tokens are not cards, but can still be **Played.**
    _See_ **_rule 170. Tokens_** _for more information._


348. Cards have different behaviors when played.
348.1. **Permanents** become **Game Objects** when **Played.**
348.2. **Spells** create game effects that are executed, then the card is placed in the trash when **Played.**
349. Cards have different states during the process of being played.
349.1. When initially being played cards are **Pending,** as **Pending Chain Items.**
349.2. Near the end of the process cards will cease being **Pending** and become **Finalized Chain Items**.
350. **The Process of Play**
351. 1. Remove the card from the zone you are playing it from and put it onto the **Chain.**
351.1. This **Closes the State.**
    _See_ **_rule 307. States of the Turn_** _for more information._
351.2. This item becomes **Pending.**
351.3. If another Card Effect or ability is currently resolving, continue resolving it before proceeding with any
    further steps of this process.
352. 2. Make necessary choices.
352.1. If the card is a spell, or has an effect that specifies a choice "As I am played," those choices are made
    now.
352.2. For **Units** , choose a valid **Location** where that **Unit** will be placed upon being **Played.**
352.3. For **Spells** and **Abilities** that **Move** one or more **Units** , choose a valid **Location** as the **Move**
    **Destination** for each **Move** that will be performed.
352.4. If a card requires you to specifically choose one or more **Game Objects** , that choice is made now.
352.4.a. This does not include cards that _affect_ one or more **Game Objects** based on criteria.
    _Example:_ "Stun a unit at a battlefield" is a **Choice.**
    _Example:_ "Kill all gear" is _not_ a **Choice.**
352.4.b. This does not include making choices for **Triggered Abilities** of permanents, even if those
    abilities trigger when the permanent is played.
       _Example:_ A unit with a triggered ability that says "When I'm played, kill a unit" does
       not require you to choose a target as it's played. The target will be chosen when the
       ability triggers.
       _See_ **_rule 375. Triggered Abilities_** _for more information._
352.5. **Targeting**
352.6. When a card **Chooses** one or more specific **Game Objects** to affect, it is **Targeted.**
352.7. In order to put a spell or ability on the chain, valid choices must be made for all targets.
352.8. A target is a valid choice if it meets all of the following requirements:
352.8.a. It is a permanent or rune on the board, a spell or ability on the chain, a player or zone, or
    specified explicitly or implicitly as being in some other zone.
       _e.g., “Kill a unit” targets a unit on the board._
       _e.g., “Recycle a unit from your trash” targets a unit card in your trash._
352.8.a.1. “Unit,” “gear,” and “rune” refer to objects on the Board unless specified otherwise.
352.8.a.2. “Spell” and “ability” refer to objects on the Chain unless specified otherwise.


352.8.a.3. “Facedown card” refers to a card in a Facedown Zone unless specified otherwise.
352.8.a.4. “Legend” refers to a legend in the Legend Zone.
352.8.a.5. “Chosen Champion” and “unit in the Champion Zone” refer to a unit in the
Champion Zone unless specified otherwise.
352.8.b. It meets all targeting restrictions.
_e.g., A unit is a valid target for a spell that refers to a “unit at a battlefield,” “enemy
unit,” “unit you control,” or “unit with Might 4 or greater” only if it meets the
appropriate criteria._
352.8.c. It is not the spell or ability itself.
_e.g., A spell that says “Counter a spell” cannot target itself.
e.g., An ability of a permanent can target that permanent, because abilities and
their sources are separate objects._
352.9. If a spell or ability requires one or more players to choose objects, players, or zones that are not
targets, those choices are made on resolution.
352.9.a. Passive abilities never have targets.
352.9.b. Replacement effects never have targets.
352.9.c. Units and gear never have targets, although their abilities may.
352.10. A game object, player, or zone mentioned in the text of a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability is a
target UNLESS any of the following are true:
352.10.a. It is in a zone whose information status is not Public.
_e.g., “Ready a legend” targets a legend, because the Legend Zone is Public.
e.g., “Return a unit from your trash to your hand” targets a unit card in your trash,
because your trash is Public.
e.g., “You may play a unit from your hand, ignoring its costs” does not target a unit
card in your hand, because your hand is not a public zone._
352.10.a.1. Public zones are Battlefield Zones, Bases, Trashes, Legend Zones, Champion Zones,
and Facedown Zones.
352.10.b. It is included only as part of a targeting restriction for another choice.
_e.g., “Kill a unit at a battlefield” targets a unit, but not a battlefield, because the
units are targets and “at a battlefield” is a restriction.
e.g., “Kill all units at a battlefield” targets a battlefield, but not any units.
e.g., “Move a unit to a battlefield” targets both a unit and a battlefield._
352.10.c. It is included only as part of a cost, trigger condition, or replacement effect.
_e.g., “As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit” doesn’t target anything.
e.g., “When a friendly unit dies, kill a gear” targets a gear, but not a friendly unit.
e.g., “When you play me, the next time a friendly unit would die this turn, return it
to your hand instead” doesn’t target anything. The replacement effect applies
when any friendly unit dies.
e.g., “Choose a friendly unit. The next time it would die this turn, return it to your
hand instead” targets a friendly unit, because “choose a friendly unit” is not part of
the replacement effect._
352.10.c.1. This includes costs within instructions, identified by phrases like “[do X] to [do Y].”
The cost within that instruction is “[do X].”
_e.g., “When I hold, you may kill another friendly unit here to draw 1” does
not target anything.
e.g., “When you play me, you may spend a buff to move a friendly unit”
targets the friendly unit, but not the buff._


352.10.d. It is programmatically selected based on its characteristics rather than chosen by the spell or
ability’s controller.
_e.g., “Kill all units at a battlefield” targets a battlefield, but does not target any
units.
e.g., “Kill all units at battlefields” doesn’t target anything.
e.g., “Destroy a unit. Its controller draws 2 cards” targets the unit, but not its
controller.
e.g., “Ready your legend” doesn’t target anything, because you can only have one
legend.
e.g., “Ready a friendly legend” targets a legend, because in a 2v2 game there are
two friendly legends.
e.g., “Recycle all cards in your trash” doesn’t target anything, because it affects all
cards and you only have one trash._
352.10.d.1. This exception applies solely to objects for which no choice is ever possible.
352.10.d.2. This exception does not apply to objects that are the only valid choice at the
moment a spell or ability is placed on the chain, but which would require a choice
under other circumstances.
_e.g., “Kill a unit at a battlefield” always targets a unit, even if that unit is
the only unit currently at a battlefield._
352.10.e. It is part of a set of objects chosen in whole or in part by other players.
_e.g., “Each player kills a unit they control” does not target. Each player, including
the one who played the spell, chooses a unit to kill as the spell or ability resolves._
352.10.f. It is identified in an instruction that a player “must” complete.
_e.g., “You must recycle one of your runes” doesn’t target anything. You choose from
among your runes as the spell or ability resolves.
e.g., “Recycle a rune you control” targets a rune. You choose a rune you control as
you put the spell or ability on the chain._
352.11. Some cards identify a group of **Targets** with **Targeting Requirements** that must be met by the
group as a whole.
352.11.a. As they’re finalized on the chain, such cards can choose any group of valid targets that
collectively fulfill the targeting restriction.
352.11.b. If the group of targets no longer collectively fulfill the targeting restriction as the spell or
ability resolves, that spell or ability’s controller can choose a subset of the original targets
that fulfills the targeting requirement for the spell or ability to affect.
_Example:_ A player plays Fox-Fire, a spell that says in part “Kill any number of units at
a battlefield with total Might 4 or less.” That player chooses four 1 [M] Recruit tokens
at a single battlefield. As a Reaction, another player gives two of those Recruits +1
[M], so the Recruits’ Mights are 1, 1, 2, and 2. Then Fox-Fire resolves. The Recruits no
longer have total Might 4 or less, so Fox-Fire’s controller must choose a legal subset
of the original targets to affect. They could choose to kill the two 2 [M] Recruits, or
the two 1 [M] Recruits plus one 2 [M] Recruit. The units they choose are Fox-Fire’s
remaining legal targets. They can’t choose to affect units at the same battlefield
that weren’t initially chosen as targets, and they can’t affect any units that are no
longer at the chosen battlefield.
352.12. If a card specifies that a player _may_ choose some number of **Game Objects** to be affected by a card,
then all choices are considered targeted and chosen independently.
352.13. If a card specifies that a player chooses “any number” or “up to” some number of **Game Objects** to be
affected, they may choose any number of available targets, including zero. If they choose zero, the
spell or ability can be played without any targets.
352.14. **Splitting**
352.14.a. If a card specifies that an amount of damage may be _split_ among some number of **Units** ,
then each **Unit** chosen is **Targeted.**


352.14.b. The **Targets** are chosen when the spell or ability is finalized on the chain.
352.14.c. A number of **Targets** can only be chosen up to, and not exceeding, the initial amount of
damage available when the spell is played. _Example:_ A player playing a spell that instructs
them to "Split 5 damage" may only choose up to 5 units, but may choose fewer.
352.14.d. Each **Target** is valid, and contributes to **Chosen** triggers individually.
352.14.e. The choice of how much damage is divided across the split is not decided until the
resolution of the spell or ability.
352.14.f. Each **Target** must receive a valid amount of damage.
352.14.g. Valid damage is a positive integer amount, greater than or equal to 1 damage.
352.14.h. If, at resolution of the spell or effect, there are more **Targets** than available damage to divide,
then the player who controls the effect dealing damage determines which **Targets** cease
being **Targets.**
352.14.i. Any costs that were paid, or effects that were triggered as a result of those **Game Objects**
being chosen as **Targets** remain in effect, paid, or otherwise triggered.
352.15. These choices cannot be changed after this step.
352.16. A player may not make choices during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or
actions later in this process unless they have no choice.
_Example:_ A player plays Cruel Patron, which says "As an additional cost to play me, kill a
friendly unit." They control exactly one unit, which is at a battlefield. They can't choose to play
Cruel Patron to that battlefield, because by the time they have finished paying costs, they
will no longer control that battlefield.

353. 3. Determine Total Cost.
353.1. If an ability or instruction allows you to "ignore" one or more of a card's costs, set the appropriate **Base**
    **Cost(s)** of the card to zero.
353.1.a. If a card allows a player to play a card "ignoring its cost," its base **Energy cost** and base
    **Power cost** are set to zero.
353.1.b. If a card instructs a player to play a card "ignoring its Energy cost" or "ignoring its Power
    cost," only the appropriate cost is set to zero, and the remaining cost still applies.
353.1.c. Further additional costs and/or cost increases applied in subsequent steps may raise the
    card's **Total Cost** above zero.
       _Example:_ Legion Rearguard is a Fury unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Power and has
       Accelerate. A player plays Legion Rearguard and is instructed to ignore its costs, but
       chooses to pay the Accelerate cost. They ignore Legion Rearguard's **Base Cost** of 2
       Energy, but the optional additional cost of 1 Energy and 1 Fury Power is added to its
       **Total Cost** and must be paid.
353.2. Apply additional costs in any order.
353.2.a. **Mandatory Additional Costs**
353.2.a.1. Some **Additional Costs** specified by **Passive Abilities** on the card being played or
    another card are **Mandatory** , and must be paid to complete playing the card. They
    use the phrase "as an additional cost" and don't include the word "may."
       _Example:_ A unit has the passive ability "As an additional cost to play me,
       kill a friendly unit." To play that unit, a player must kill a friendly unit.
       _See_ **_rule 360. Passive Abilities_** _for more information._
353.2.a.2. The cost imposed by the **Deflect** keyword is a **Mandatory Additional Cost.**
    _See_ **_rule 725. Deflect_** _for more information._


353.2.b. **Optional Additional Costs**
353.2.b.1. Some **Optional Costs** specified by **Passive Abilities** on the card being played or
another card are **Non-Mandatory** , and must be paid only if the player made the
choice to pay them in **rule 352.** They use the phrase "as an additional cost" and the
word "may."
_Example:_ A unit has the ability "As you play me, you may discard 1 as an
additional cost. If you do, reduce my cost by [2]." While playing the unit, its
controller declares their intention to pay the additional cost in **rule 352** ,
applies that additional cost in **rule 353.2** , applies the discount granted by
paying that cost in **rule 353.4** , and discards a card to pay that additional
cost in **rule 354.2.**
_See_ **_rule 360. Passive Abilities_** _for more information._
353.3. Apply cost increases.
353.4. Apply discounts in any order.
353.4.a. Discounts may be applied by the card being played or by any other card or effect.
353.4.b. Discounts may say that cards "cost [amount] less" or that one or more of their costs are
"reduced by [amount]."
353.4.c. If a discount applies a minimum cost, that minimum applies only to that discount.
_Example:_ Eager Apprentice says "While I'm at a battlefield, the Energy costs for
spells you play is reduced by [1], to a minimum of [1]." A player who controls Eager
Apprentice and a unit with 7 Might plays Sky Splitter, a spell that costs 8 Energy
and says "This spell's Energy cost is reduced by the highest Might among units you
control." That player can choose to apply Eager Apprentice's discount first, reducing
Sky Splitter's Energy cost to 7, then apply Sky Splitter's discount, reducing its Energy
cost to 0. If they applied these discounts in the other order, Sky Splitter's Energy
cost would be 1.
353.4.d. Discounts can reduce additional costs, including to 0.
353.4.d.1. An optional additional cost was "paid" if the player made the decision in **rule 352** to
pay it. It doesn't matter how much the player actually paid.
_Example:_ Clockwork Keeper is a unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Power and
says "As you play me, you may pay [C] as an additional cost. If you do, draw
" A player controls a card that says "Units you play cost [A] less." That player
plays Clockwork Keeper and chooses to pay the optional additional cost of
[C]. They will draw a card, even though the optional additional cost was
reduced to 0.
353.5. Energy and Power costs can't be reduced below 0.
353.6. **Costs** may be Energy costs, Power costs, or non-standard costs. _Example:_ A card reads "As an
additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." Killing a friendly unit is an additional cost to play that
card.

354. 4. Pay the card's costs.
354.1. In total, pay the combined **Energy** cost (if any) and **Power** cost (if any).
354.1.a. During this step, the spell's controller can use activated abilities with the **Reaction** tag that
    **Add** resources to add **Energy** and **Power** to pay the spell's costs.
       _See_ **_rule 158. Rune Pools_** _and_ **_rule 416. Add_** _for more information._
354.2. In addition, pay any non-standard **Cost** summed in **rule 353.2** in any order.


354.2.a. Costs that are replaced with other events by replacement effects are still considered paid.
_Example:_ A player plays Cruel Patron, which says "As an additional cost to play me,
kill a friendly unit." They also control Zhonya’s Hourglass, which says “If a friendly
unit would die, kill this instead. Heal that unit, exhaust it, and recall it.” They choose
to kill a friendly unit during **rule 353.2** , but as they pay the cost in **rule 354.2** ,
Zhonya’s Hourglass replaces that unit’s death. The cost is considered paid, and the
player can continue playing Cruel Patron.
354.3. A player may not pay costs during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or
actions later in this process unless they have no choice.
_Example:_ A player plays Cruel Patron, which says "As an additional cost to play me, kill a
friendly unit." They control multiple units, one of which is alone at a battlefield. During **rule
352.2.** , they chose to play Cruel Patron to that battlefield. While paying costs, they can't
choose to kill the unit at that battlefield, because then they will no longer control that
battlefield and Cruel Patron cannot legally be played there. If they controlled that battlefield
with multiple units, any of those units would be a legal choice, because they would still
control the battlefield after killing one.

355. 5. Check legality.
355.1. Check that all chosen targets are legal.
355.2. Ensure that the outcome of the effect of this card being played would not create an illegal state.
    _Example:_ Check that a spell's execution does not create a state where a Battlefield has **Units**
    controlled by 3 different players.
355.3. If the card, if continued to be played, would create an illegal state, or if a choice or action at this state
    is illegal, the actions taken in this process are undone and the action is cancelled.
356. 6. Finalize this card and proceed with the card's category of **Play.**
356.1. This card is no longer **Pending**.
356.2. A **Permanent** leaves the **Chain** and becomes a **Game Object.**
356.2.a. Any passive abilities become active.
356.2.b. Execute all rules text on the card, from top to bottom.
356.2.c. If it is a **Unit** , it enters **the Board exhausted** at the **Location** that was chosen.
356.2.d. If it is a **Gear,** it enters **the Board Ready** at the player's **Base.**
356.3. A **Spell** lingers on the **Chain.**
356.3.a. This card becomes a Finalized **Chain Item.**
356.3.b. If there are other **Pending Items** on the Chain, then the controller of those **Pending Items**
    completes Steps 2 through 5 of Playing Cards for those items before continuing.
       _See_ **_rule 326. Chains_** _for more information_.
356.3.c. Other players have an opportunity to play **Reactions** before the resolution of spells.
    _See_ **_rule 326. Chains_** _for more information._
356.3.d. Otherwise, execute the game effect of the spell, from top to bottom of the rules text of the
    card and then place the card in the **Trash** of the _owning_ player.
356.3.e. Handling illegal and impossible instructions
356.3.e.1. The spell resolves even if some or all of its targets are illegal.
356.3.e.2. A target is illegal as the spell resolves if it no longer meets the targeting
    requirements of the spell, or if it has changed **Zones** to or from a **Non-Board Zone.**


356.3.e.3. If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain,
then meets them again, it's a legal target.
_Example:_ A spell targets "a unit at a battlefield." A player reacts with a spell
that moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that
moves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is
a legal target.
356.3.e.4. If a target changes **Zones** to or from a **Non-Board Zone** and then returns to its
original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it's not treated as the same
object.
_Examples:_
An enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an
enemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield.
A unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit
or if its Might is greater than 3.
Something that's exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer
exhausted. (It can't stop being "something.")
A spell that's played from hidden has the additional targeting requirement
"here." A target for such a spell ceases to be a legal target if it moves from
the battlefield where that spell was played, even if the spell has no location
targeting requirement otherwise.
356.3.e.5. If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the
spell as it resolves.
_Example:_ A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says "Deal 4 to a unit at a
battlefield. Draw 1." The unit's controller uses a Reaction to move the unit
to their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any
damage. Void Seeker's controller still draws 1.
356.3.e.6. Instructions that can't be followed, either because of illegal targets or other
circumstances, are ignored.
356.3.e.7. If **_all_** of an instruction's **Targets** become **Invalid** or **Unavailable** by the time the
spell is finished being played, that instruction will not execute.
356.3.e.8. If an instruction has more than one **Target** and fewer than **_all_** of the **Targets**
become **Invalid** or **Unavailable** by the time the spell is finished being played, the
instruction will execute, with only the **Targets** available and valid being operated
on.
356.3.e.9. The process for a card's choice **becoming Invalid** or **Unavailable** is referred to as
**mistargeting.**
_Example:_ A spell has the instruction "Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield."
Before that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its base.
The instruction will _not_ be executed, because it specifies that the unit it
chooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute,
the unit was no longer valid as a choice.
356.3.e.10. It is possible for **_none_** of a spell's instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all
of them requiring targets to act on and **_all_** of those targets becoming **Invalid** or
**Unavailable**. In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played.
_Example:_ A player plays a spell that reads "Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield"
with no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield.
They also control a unit with the ability "When you play a spell, give me +1
[M] this turn." Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its
base. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but
the unit's ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M].
356.3.e.11. Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and
ignored otherwise.


```
Example: A player plays a spell that says "Discard 2, then draw 2" If their
hand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. They'll still draw
```
2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2.
356.3.e.12. If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or
permanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information
is no longer available, that check returns "null" and all calculations based on it are
ignored.
_Examples:_
A unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having null Might, null
cost, etc.
A unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted
nor readied, etc.
Baited Hook says "[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of
your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might
up to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle
the rest." While Baited Hook’s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts
with a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner's hand. Because the
friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be killed and its Might is
treated as null. Baited Hook’s controller reveals the top 5 cards of their
Main Deck, but can’t choose any unit from among them.
356.3.e.13. A spell or ability that moves something to a different zone as a cost or effect can
"look back" at its characteristics before it changes zones.

### 357. Abilities

358. An **Ability** is the structured rules and capabilities of **Game Objects** or **Spells.**
358.1. An **Ability** has multiple structures.
    **Passive Abilities**
    **Replacement Effects**
    **Activated Abilities**
    **Triggered Abilities**
    **Delayed Abilities**
359. A card can have more than one **Ability** and more than one type of **Ability.**
360. Passive Abilities
361. Conditions, rules, constraints, or statements that affect the course of regular play.
361.1. These abilities have a wide variety of formats to recognize.
    _Example:_ "I get +1[M] while you have 2 or more cards in your hand."
    _Example:_ "Friendly Yordles at my battlefield have [Shield]."
361.2. They can be recognized by being **statements of fact.**
361.3. **Passive Abilities** can be conditional.
361.3.a. **Conditional Passive Abilities** can be recognized by the occurrence of "if" or "while" as part of
    the statement of the ability.
       _Example:_ " **While** I'm attacking or defending alone, I have +2 [M]."
       _Example:_ " **If** an opponent controls a battlefield, I enter ready."
362. Presence on **Permanents**
362.1. Passive Abilities of **Permanents** are typically only active while on **the Board.**


363. Presence on **Card outside of the Board**
363.1. **Passive Abilities** of cards in zones that are outside of **the Board** will self-describe their context.
    _Example:_ The passive ability "Play me only during an opponent's turn." applies in any zone
    from which that card can be played.
363.2. **Passive Abilities** can alter the costs of cards as they are played.
363.2.a. These apply at all times in any zone from which the card with the ability can be played.
364. Replacement Effects
365. An ability that alters the application of another game effect or game rule.
365.1. **Passive Abilities** can be **Replacement Effects.**
365.2. **Triggered Abilities** can be **Replacement Effects.**
366. **Replacement Effects** intercede during the execution of a Game Effect and alter its execution.
366.1. A **Replacement Effect** can be identified by the presence of the term "instead."
    _Example:_ Zhonya's Hourglass reads "The next time a friendly unit would die, kill this instead.
    Recall that unit exhausted." This is a replacement effect that alters the execution of any
    Game Effect that would kill a friendly unit.
367. A **Replacement Effect** can alter the typical flow of play, including other cards' executions.
368. If more than one **Replacement Effect** applies to the same event being executed, then the owner of the object
    being acted on determines the order the **Replacement Effects** will apply.
368.1. If it is a player being acted on, that player decides the order the **Replacement Effects** will apply.
368.2. If the affected object is an **Uncontrolled Battlefield** then the **Current Turn Player** decides the order
    the **Replacement Effects** will apply.
369. Activated Abilities
370. **Activated Abilities** are repeatable effects with a cost. They follow a process of going onto the chain and
    resolving, similar to **Playing a Card.**
       _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
370.1. **Activated Abilities** are recognized by the presence of a ":" in the text of the card, preceded by a cost
    and succeeded by an effect.
       _Example:_ "[2]: Draw 1" is an activated ability. The **cost** is 2 energy. The **effect** is to draw 1 card.
370.2. **Activated Abilities** use the chain.
370.2.a. Declare activation of the **Ability.**
370.2.a.1. The ability goes on the chain but has no card to represent it, so players need to take
    note that it is now a **Closed State.**
370.2.b. Proceed with executing the **Chain.**
370.2.b.1. Follow the steps of “Playing or Activating Abilities” in **rule 386**. This ability will
    become a **Pending Chain Item.**
370.2.b.2. Opponents have an opportunity to respond, as appropriate, as if a card was played
    onto the chain.
370.2.b.3. If no further action is taken, execute the **Activated Ability.**
371. The controlling player chooses when and whether to activate an **Activated Ability.**
372. Activated abilities are present on **Game Objects** and some **Spells.**


373. Can primarily be activated while on **the Board.**
374. All **Activated Abilities** can only be activated on the _Controlling Player's Turn_ and during an **Open State.**
375. Triggered Abilities
376. **Triggered Abilities** are repeatable effects that happen when a **Condition** is met.
376.1. **Triggered Abilities** can usually be recognized by the word "when" followed by a game action or
    event; the word "at" followed by a point in time during the turn sequence; or the phrase “the [Nth]
    time” followed by a game action or event.
       _Examples:_
       " **When** you conquer here, you may spend a buff to draw 1."
       "At the end of your turn, ready 2 runes."
       “The first time I move each turn, you may ready something else that's exhausted.”
376.1.a. The phrases that identify triggered abilities do not always appear at the beginning of
    sentences or abilities.
       _Example:_ Sona, Harmonious says “While I'm at a battlefield, ready up to 4 friendly
       runes at the end of your turn.” Although the ability starts with a conditional, “while,”
       the phrase “at the end of your turn” identifies this as a triggered ability. It can only
       trigger while that condition is met.
376.1.b. If an ability triggers “the [Nth] time” something happens and that trigger condition is met
    multiple times simultaneously, the ability’s controller picks one of those instances to serve as
    the trigger condition. The ability triggers only once, due to the chosen condition.
       _Example:_ Wraith of Echoes reads “The first time another friendly unit dies each turn,
       draw 1.” That ability hasn’t triggered yet this turn. Two other friendly units die
       simultaneously (say, due to combat damage). The Wraith’s controller chooses one
       of those deaths to trigger Wraith’s ability.
376.2. **Triggered Abilities** have a **Condition** and an **Effect.**
376.2.a. The **Condition** follows the **When.**
376.2.b. The **Effect** is the **Instruction** that follows the comma after the **Condition.**
376.2.c. The **Condition** of a **Trigger** is evaluated after a potentially inciting event has been processed.
376.2.c.1. If a **Game Object** with a **Triggered Ability** that is active in a specific zone, it is
    evaluated and subsequently triggered if it enters that zone at the same time that
    its **Trigger** ’s condition is met.
       _Example:_ Immortal Phoenix says “When you kill a unit with a spell, you
       may pay [1][C] to play me from your trash.” This ability triggers if Immortal
       Phoenix is in your trash immediately after you kill a unit with a spell, even if
       the unit you killed with a spell was that Immortal Phoenix.
376.2.c.2. A **Game Object** will not be able to successfully be able to evaluate its **Trigger**
    **Condition** , however, if it leaves the zone that its **Trigger** is active from at the same
    time that its **Trigger** is satisfied.
       _Example:_ Viktor, Leader says “When another non-Recruit unit you control
       dies, play a 1 [M] Recruit unit token into your base.” This ability triggers if
       Viktor is on the board immediately after another non-Recruit unit you
       control dies. It does _not_ trigger if Viktor and another non-Recruit unit you
       control die during the same game action (for instance, if they are both
       killed in the same Cleanup due to the damage dealt by Unchecked
       Power).
376.3. When a **Condition** is met, a **Triggered Ability** behaves like an **Activated Ability** and is placed on the
    **Chain.**


376.3.a. **Triggered Abilities** can be put on the **Chain** during **Closed States** or **Open States** on any
player's turn.
376.3.b. If more than one **Triggered Ability** is **Triggered** simultaneously, then the player that controls
the **Abilities** selects the order to place them on the **Chain.**
376.3.b.1. If multiple players separately control **Triggered Abilities** that are **Triggered**
simultaneously, then starting with the **Turn Player** and proceeding in **Turn Order** ,
each player orders their **Triggered Abilities** on the **Chain.**
376.4. Some **Conditions** are commonly used and structured in a way that explicitly defines their use and
other properties of the **Effect** that is associated with it.
376.4.a. **Play Effects** are **Triggered Abilities** with the **Condition** that the **Permanent** that has the
**Play Effect** being played to the board.
376.4.a.1. These are commonly structured as “When you play me...” for **Units** and “When you
play this...” for **Gear.**
376.4.a.2. These **Triggered Abilities** are put on the **Chain** as **Pending Items** after the
**Permanent** these effects correspond to is finalized and enters the board.
376.4.a.3. These **Triggered Abilities** can be referred to as Play Effects.
376.4.a.4. Abilities that trigger when another object is played are not considered Play Effects.
376.4.b. **Conquer Effects** are **Triggered Abilities** with a **Condition** of a **Unit** participating in, and
successfully **Conquering** a **Battlefield.**
376.4.b.1. These are commonly structured as “When I conquer...” and “When you conquer...”
376.4.b.2. This category of **Triggered Abilities** encompasses only those that are triggered
from **Units** that were present during the **Conquer** action, or **Abilities** that reference
the player that performed the **Conquer** action.
376.4.b.2.a. The **Conquer Abilities** of **Units** are put on the **Chain** as **Pending Items**
after the **Unit(s)** these effects correspond to are present at a **Battlefield**
when a player gains control of it and gains 1 Victory Point from
**Conquering.**
376.4.b.2.b. The **Conquer Abilities** of anything that references the player **Conquering**
is put on the **Chain** as a **Pending Item** when the **Condition** that the player
that controls the triggering source has performed a **Conquer** and gained 1
Victory Point.
376.4.b.2.c. If the act of gaining one point from **Conquering** is negated or replaced in
any way, the **Conquer Effect** will still trigger.
376.4.b.3. These **Triggered Abilities** can be referred to as Conquer Effects.
376.4.c. **Hold Effects** are **Triggered Abilities** with a **Condition** of a **Unit** being present at a
**Battlefield** during the **Beginning phase** when a player scores **Victory Points** from **Holding.**
376.4.c.1. These are commonly structured as “When I hold...” or “When you hold...”
376.4.c.2. This category of **Triggered Abilities** encompasses only those that are triggered
from **Units** that were present during the **Hold** action, or **Abilities** that reference the
player that performed the **Hold** action.
376.4.c.2.a. The **Hold Abilities** of **Units** are put on the **Chain** as **Pending Items** after
the **Unit** these effects correspond to are present at a **Battlefield** when a
player maintains control of it and Gains 1 Victory Point during their
**Beginning Phase** from **Holding.**


376.4.c.2.b. The **Hold Abilities** of anything that references the player **Holding** is put on
the **Chain** as a **Pending Item** when the **Condition** that the player that
controls the triggering source has performed a **Hold** and gained 1 Victory
Point.
376.4.c.2.c. If the act of gaining one point from **Holding** is negated or replaced in any
way, the **Hold Effect** will still trigger.
376.4.c.3. These **Triggered Abilities** can be referred to as Hold Effects.
376.4.d. **Attack Triggers** are **Triggered Abilities** that trigger when a **Unit** gains the **Attacker**
designation for the first time during a combat.
376.4.d.1. These are commonly structured as “When I attack...”
376.4.d.2. These **Triggered Abilities** are put on the **Chain** as **Pending Items** after the **Unit**
these effects correspond to gains the **Attacker** designation during **Combat**.
376.4.d.2.a. These triggers can only become fulfilled once per combat, despite a **Unit**
being able to gain and lose the **Attacker** designation multiple times in the
same combat.
376.4.d.3. These **Triggered Abilities** can be referred to as Attack Triggers.
376.4.e. **Defend Triggers** are **Triggered Abilities** that trigger when a **Unit** gains the **Defender**
designation for the first time during a combat.
376.4.e.1. These are commonly structured as “When I defend...”
376.4.e.2. These **Triggered Abilities** are put on the **Chain** as **Pending Items** after the **Unit**
these effects correspond to gains the **Defender** designation during **Combat**.
376.4.e.2.a. These triggers can only become fulfilled once per combat, despite a **Unit**
being able to gain and lose the **Defender** designation multiple times in
the same combat.
376.4.e.3. These **Triggered Abilities** can be referred to as Defend Triggers.

377. Presence on **Permanents**
377.1. Typically active while on **the Board.**
377.2. **Triggered Abilities** of **Permanents** are only able to have their **Conditions** evaluated while on **the**
    **Board.**
378. Presence on **Cards outside of the Board**
378.1. **Triggered Abilities** on cards outside of **the Board** rely on the **Information Level** of the zone they are
    in.
378.2. **Triggered Abilities** outside of **the Board** will self-describe their context.
    _Example:_ The triggered ability "When you conquer, you may discard 1 to return this from
    your trash to your hand." triggers while the card it's on is in the trash, and not anywhere else.
379. Reflexive Triggers
380. **Reflexive Triggers** are a type of **Triggered Ability** that create one or more **Chain Items** when their condition is
    met.
380.1. **Reflexive Triggers** can be recognized by the phrase “Do this:” or “Do one of the following:”.
380.1.a. “Do this” can be followed by “N times.” The **Reflexive Trigger** will thus be added to the chain
    N times when its condition is met.
380.2. **Reflexive Triggers** will be preceded by their conditions, if any. If no condition is present in the ability


then the **Reflexive Trigger** will always be added to the Chain.
380.3. If present, the **Condition** of a **Reflexive Trigger** will follow the same format as a **Triggered Ability.**

381. **Reflexive Triggers** use the Chain.
381.1. A new ability is created and added to the chain as a **Pending Item**.
    _See_ **_rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities_** _for more information._
381.2. If a **Reflexive Trigger** creates more than one **Pending Item** it creates them all in order, but does not
    go beyond the first step of adding them to the Chain.
       _See_ **_rule 386. Playing or Activating Abilities_** _for more information._
382. Delayed Abilities
383. **Delayed Abilities** are a type of **Ability** whose trigger Condition identifies a specific time during a turn or a
    specific event that can occur during a specific timeframe.
383.1. **Delayed Abilities** can be any other type of **Ability** , and contain all of the properties of that type in
    addition to the properties of **Delayed Abilities.**
383.2. **Delayed Triggers** are **Triggered Abilities** that can be recognized by describing a specific time of the
    turn, or by structuring a **Triggered Ability** with a specific frame of time as a restriction.
383.3. **Delayed Replacements** are **Replacement Effects** that can be recognized by specifying the effect
    they are replacing at a specific time, or “the [Nth] time” in the description of the effect as it resolves.
383.4. **Delayed Passive Abilities** are **Passive Abilities** that are applicable only during a specified window of
    time. The time that the **Delayed Passive Ability** applies will be recognized in the effect that initiates
    it.
384. **Delayed Abilities** will resolve or be active just like the ability they augment, but only during the specified time
    in the effect that created the **Delayed Ability.**
       _Example:_ Ravenborn Tome reads “The next spell you play this turn deals 1 Bonus Damage” is a
       **Delayed Passive Ability** that passively adds 1 damage to just the next spell played. The next spell is a
       specific time, and the 1 Bonus Damage is a passive ability.
       _Example:_ Noxian Guillotine reads “Choose a unit. Kill it the next time it takes damage this turn.” When
       the chosen unit takes damage is the specified time, and killing it is the condition for a **Delayed**
       **Triggered Ability.**
385. **Delayed Abilities** are not associated with **Units** or **Gear;** they are created by other **Abilities** or **Spells**. As such
    they are executed when their condition and/or specified time occurs regardless of whether the source of the
    **Delayed Ability** is still on the board or not.
386. Playing or Activating Abilities
387. Playing or activating **Abilities** follows the same steps of playing cards.
388. **Abilities** when added to the Chain become **Pending Items** until they complete the steps of **Playing.**
388.1. When an **Ability** finishes the steps of playing it becomes a **Chain Item** just like a **Spell.**
388.2. When an **Ability** with the [Add] action is finalized it resolves immediately instead of becoming a
    **Chain Item** , like a **Unit** or **Gear.**
389. 1. Activate or trigger the **Ability**
389.1. Add a **Pending Item** to the chain representing the **Ability** that is either being Activated or Triggered.
    Notably, although this Chain Item will not have a card representing it, this will create a **Closed State.**
       _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
389.2. If there is currently a game effect being resolved, continue resolving the game effect instead of
    continuing the following steps.


390. 2. Make relevant choices
390.1. Make all choices required for this ability, such as targets, options, or other relevant decisions.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information_
390.2. If legal options are not available for an **Activated Ability,** it is not legal to activate it.
390.3. If there are not enough options to make legal choices for a **Triggered Ability** that has been put on
    the chain, remove it from the Chain now. It ceases to be a **Pending Item** but never becomes a **Chain**
    **Item.**
390.3.a. This is not an **Ability** being countered.
390.3.b. If there are legal options to choose, the ability’s controller must choose them. They may not
    decline this stage of playing a **Trigger.**
391. 3. Determine Total Cost
391.1. Determine the base cost of the **Ability.**
391.1.a. **Activated Abilities** will have a cost listed before the “:” in their text.
391.1.b. **Triggered Abilities** will typically not have a base cost associated with them when placed on
    the chain due to their conditions.
391.2. Apply cost increases and decreases as a result of choices made in the prior step.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
391.3. Apply any other cost increases or decreases as necessary.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
392. 4. Pay Costs
392.1. Pay costs as determined in the prior step.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
392.2. At this stage, players may decline to pay for **Triggered Abilities** that have incurred a cost. If they do,
    the ability will cease being a **Pending Item** and be removed from the Chain. It never becomes a
    **Chain Item.**
392.2.a. This is not an **Ability** being countered.
393. 5. Check Legality
393.1. Ensure that the **Ability’s** targets are still legal.
393.2. Ensure that the **Ability** ’s effect would not create an illegal state. If it would, resolve in the same way
    you would resolve a **Card** that creates an illegal state.
       _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
394. 6. Proceed with Play
394.1. This **Ability** is no longer **Pending.**
394.2. This **Ability** becomes a **Chain Item.**
394.3. If there are other **Pending Items** on the Chain, their controllers perform the remaining steps of
    playing now.
394.4. Other players have an opportunity to play **Reactions** before the resolution of spells.
    _See_ **_rule 326. Chains_** _for more information._
394.5. Otherwise, execute the **Ability** just like a **Spell** , then clear the **Chain Item** from the Chain.


### 395. Game Actions

396. **Game Actions** are actions players may perform at any given time during the game.
397. A player, unless otherwise specified or prompted, may only perform actions on their turn.
398. There are two types of **Game Actions:**
398.1. **Discretionary Actions**
398.1.a. A **Discretionary Action** is a **Game Action** that may be performed **at any time** during a
    player's turn **during a Neutral Open State.**
       _See_ **_rule 307. States of the Turn_** _for more information._
398.1.b. A player may take any number of **Discretionary Actions** available to them during their turn.
398.1.b.1. As long as any conditions, if applicable, are met.
398.1.b.2. As long as any costs, if applicable, are paid.
398.1.b.3. As long as it does not result in any forbidden action being taken or game state
    being created.
       _Example:_ A player can't use the Standard Move discretionary action to
       move a unit to a **Battlefield** that's already occupied by **Units** controlled by
       two other players.
398.2. **Limited Actions**
398.2.a. A **Limited Action** is a game action that a spell, ability, or circumstance of the turn's
    progression causes the player to perform. A player cannot perform these actions at-will.
398.2.b. These actions can only be taken when a player is instructed to do so as the execution of an
    effect or during their specified occasion during the turn.
       _Example: A player may_ **_Draw_** _during the_ **_Draw Step_** _of the_ **_Beginning Phase_** _of_
       _their turn or when instructed to do so by a spell or ability. They can't choose to_
       **_Draw_** _at any other time._
399. Types of Actions
400. **Draw**
400.1. **Drawing** a card takes a single card from the top of the **Main Deck** and adds it to the player's **Hand.**
400.2. This is a **Limited Action.**
400.2.a. Each player draws 1 during the **Draw Step** of their **Beginning Phase.**
400.2.b. The player may draw cards when instructed to do so by other game effects.
400.3. This action, when instructed, is formatted as "Draw X."
400.4. If a player attempts to draw more cards than are available in their **Main Deck** , they do the following:
400.4.a. Draw as many as possible.
400.4.b. Perform a **Burn Out.**
    _See_ **_rule 418. Burn Out_** _for more information._
400.4.c. Draw the remaining cards needed to complete the **Draw** action.
401. **Exhaust**


401.1. **Exhausting** is an action that marks a non-spell **Game Object** as "spent."
401.1.a. To mark it, rotate the card 90 degrees opposite of **Readying** , so that the orientation of the
card is lengthwise in front of you.
401.1.b. A **Unit** that is already **Exhausted** cannot be **Exhausted** again.
401.1.c. If a **Unit** is instructed to be **Exhausted** while it is already **Exhausted** , nothing additional
happens.
401.2. **"Exhausted"** is a state for **Game Objects** that other game effects and rules can reference.
401.3. This is a **Limited Action.**
401.3.a. Most **Exhaust** actions will be costs for Activated Abilities or **Discretionary Actions.** _Example:_
A unit's Standard Move exhausts the unit as a cost.
401.4. When **Exhausting** is listed as a **Cost** , then the Action must be able to be completed for the cost to be
paid.
_Example:_ A spell says "As an additional cost to play this, you may exhaust a friendly unit." An
exhausted friendly unit may not be exhausted again as the additional cost for the spell, and
the additional cost has not been paid.
401.5. In abilities, the **Exhaust symbol** represents the cost "Exhaust this" or "Exhaust me." It resembles a
card turning sideways.

402. **Ready**
402.1. **Readying** is an action that marks a non-spell **Game Object** as available for action.
402.1.a. To mark it, rotate the card 90 degrees opposite of **Exhausting** , so that it is vertically oriented
    in front of you.
402.1.b. A **Unit** that is already **Ready** cannot be **Readied** again.
402.1.c. If a **Unit** is instructed to be **Readied** while it is already **Ready** , nothing additional happens.
402.2. **"Ready"** is a state for **Game Objects** that other game effects and rules can reference.
402.3. This is a **Limited Action.**
402.3.a. A player **Readies** all non-spell **Game Objects** they **Control** during the **Ready Step** of the
    **Beginning Phase** on their turn.
402.3.b. The player may also **Ready** their **Game Objects** when effects or spells instruct them to do so.
403. **Recycle**
403.1. **Recycling** cards is the action in which a player takes one or more cards from a specific zone and then
    puts it on the bottom of the corresponding deck.
403.1.a. **Main Deck** cards are **Recycled** to the **Main Deck.**
403.1.b. **Runes** are **Recycled** to the **Rune Deck.**
403.1.c. Each player **Recycles** cards to their own **Main Deck** and **Rune Deck** , regardless of which
    player is instructed to perform the **Recycle** action.
403.2. This is a **Limited Action.**
403.2.a. The player must **Recycle** cards from the specified zones when instructed to do so by game
    effects or costs.


403.3. When **Recycling** is listed as a **Cost** , the action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid.
_Example:_ Vi, Destructive has the ability "Recycle 1 from your trash: Give me +1 [M] this turn."
Each time a player activates the ability, they must recycle 1 card from their trash to pay its
cost. If they have no cards in their trash, they can't activate the ability, because they can't pay
its cost.
403.4. When **Recycling** is part of an effect, a player must **Recycle** as many cards as possible from the
specified zone or zones.
403.5. If 2 or more cards are **Recycled** to the **Main Deck** simultaneously, they are placed on the bottom of
that deck in a random order.
_Example:_ Garbage Grabber has the ability "Recycle 3 from your trash, [1], [E]: Draw " To pay
the cost of activating this ability, its controller chooses 3 cards from their trash and places
them on the bottom of their **Main Deck** in a random order.
403.5.a. If 2 or more cards are **Recycled** to the **Rune Deck** simultaneously, they are placed on the
bottom of that deck in the order of their owner's choosing.
403.6. This action, when instructed, is sometimes formatted as " **Recycle** X from [Zone]." That means to take
X cards of the instructed player's choice from the relevant zone and recycle them.
_Example:_ Dr. Mundo, Expert has the ability "At the start of your Beginning Phase, recycle 3
from your trash." As that ability resolves, its controller recycles 3 cards from their trash. If
there are fewer than 3 cards in that player's trash, they recycle as many as they can.

404. **Deal**
404.1. Spells, Units, Abilities, and other game effects may **Deal Damage** to units.
404.1.a. Assigning **Damage** during Combat Resolution is not **Dealing Damage,** but will cause
    **Damage** to be **Dealt** when assignment is complete.
404.1.b. To **Deal Damage** to **Units,** mark the specified amount of **Damage** on the **Unit.**
404.1.c. **Damage** is marked on each unit separately.
404.1.d. **Damage** can be **Dealt** to more than one **Unit** at the same time.
404.2. Only **Damage** can be **Dealt.**
404.3. **Dealing Damage** is a **Limited Action.**
404.3.a. Assigning **Damage** causes **Damage** to be dealt outside of being directed to **Deal Damage.**
    _See_ **_rule 433. Combat_** _for more information._
404.4. **Dealing** can have the intrinsic property of **Bonus Damage.**
404.5. **Bonus Damage** is a property granted to the action of **Dealing** and alters the amount of **Damage**
    distributed by this action.
       _See_ **_rule 712. Bonus Damage_** _for more information._
404.6. **Deal** actions can originate from one or more sources.
404.6.a. If a game effect does not specify a source, the game effect describing the **Deal** action is the
    source.
       _Example:_ Void Seeker is a spell that reads “Deal 4 to a unit at a battlefield. Draw 1.”
       The damage that Void Seeker instructs you to deal is dealt by Void Seeker.
404.6.b. If a game effect does specify a source, then that source is what is considered the origin of
    the **Damage** for this **Deal** action.
404.6.b.1. Units and Spells can be the source of **Damage** for **Deal** actions.
404.6.b.2. Abilities can be the source of **Damage** for **Deal** actions.


404.6.b.2.a. When an Ability is the source of **Damage** for a **Deal** action, it is in addition
to the Spell or Unit that created that Ability.
_Example:_ Iron Ballista is a gear that says “[E]: Deal 2 to a unit at a
battlefield.” This damage is dealt both by a gear and by an ability.
404.6.b.3. When a spell or ability specifies a Unit as the source of the **Damage** for the **Deal**
action, it is not in addition to the spell or ability that specified it.
_Example:_ Challenge is a spell that reads “Choose a friendly unit and an
enemy unit. They deal damage equal to their Mights to each other.” The
damage that Challenge causes to be dealt is dealt by the chosen units, not
by Challenge.
404.6.c. **Damage Dealt** as a result of being assigned during **Combat** has the **Units** as its source.
404.6.c.1. The **Damage** assigned, and subsequently **Dealt** , to attackers has the defenders as
the source and vice versa.
404.7. **Deal** actions can distribute **Damage** as part of combat actions or non-combat actions.

405. **Heal**
405.1. **Damage** being cleared from **Units** is **Healing.**
405.1.a. If **Damage** is cleared for any reason it is considered **Healing.**
405.2. More than one **Unit** can be **Healed** at the same time.
405.3. **Healing** is a **Limited Action.**
405.3.a. Players may only **Heal** units when game effects instruct them to, or at specific points in the
    turn.
406. **Play**
406.1. A player **Plays** cards by paying costs associated with that card.
    _See_ **_rule 346. Playing Cards_** _for more information._
406.2. This is a **Discretionary Action.**
406.2.a. As long as a player has the resources to pay the costs associated with the card, they may
    **play** cards.
406.3. Game effects may result in cards being **played** as part of their resolution.
406.3.a. This treats **Play** as a **Limited Action.**
406.3.b. Treat all steps of **Play** as normal, except as noted by the game effect creating this **Limited**
    **Play Effect.**
406.3.c. If there are no eligible cards to **Play** when instructed to **Play** in this manner like this, then
    nothing happens and resolution continues.
406.4. Some **Abilities** trigger when cards are played or otherwise check whether cards have been played.
406.4.a. These abilities trigger when the act of playing the card has been _completed_ by the
    resolution of the card.
406.4.b. If a game effect prevents the resolution of the card—for example, because the card was
    **countered** —the card wasn't played and no abilities that trigger on playing cards trigger.
       _See_ **_rule 412. Counter_** _for more information._
407. **Move**
407.1. **Moving** is the act of a **Game Object** moving between two **Locations** on **The Board.**


407.2. **Moving** is a **Limited Action.**
407.2.a. Players may only move **Game Objects** when instructed to do so by Game Effects or costs.
407.2.b. The **Standard Move** inherent to **Units** may also cause **Movement.**
_See_ **_rule 140_** _for more information on the_ **_Standard Move_**_._
407.3. The **Standard Move** inherent to **Units** is a **Discretionary Action.**
407.3.a. The **Cost** is **Exhausting** one or more **Units.**
407.3.b. The **Effect** is **Moving** those **Unit.**

408. **Hide**
408.1. **Hiding** a card is the act of placing a card facedown at a **Battlefield** you control.
408.2. **Hiding** is a **Discretionary Action.**
408.2.a. The **Hidden** keyword allows a player to pay a cost to **Hide** a card any time they have a
    **Hidden** card in their hand or Champion Zone and meet the prerequisites.
       _See_ **_rule 727. Hidden_** _for more information._
408.3. Cards that are facedown at **Battlefields** have their gameplay properties and permissions defined by
    the effect that put them there.
       _Example:_ Cards that players **Hide** with the **Hidden** keyword can be **Played** for [0] on any
       subsequent turn as a property of the **Hidden** keyword.
408.4. If a facedown card would be put into a zone whose **Privacy** is **Private** or **Secret** , or if the game ends,
    its owner reveals it to all players.
       _See_ **_rule 127. Privacy_** _for more information._
409. **Discard**
409.1. **Discarding** a card is moving it from a player's hand directly into their trash without activating or
    executing its normal rules text.
409.1.a. The player who is performing the action chooses which cards to send to their **Trash** , and
    may use **Private Information** to do so.
409.1.b. “When I am discarded” abilities or other **Triggered Abilities** that trigger on discarding are
    executed after discarding has occurred.
409.2. **Discarding** is a **Limited Action.**
409.2.a. A player must **Discard** cards when instructed to do so by game effects or costs.
409.3. When **Discarding** is listed as a **Cost** , then the Action must be able to be completed for the cost to be
    paid.
       _Example:_ A card has the ability "Discard 2: Deal 2 damage to a unit at a battlefield." To
       activate the ability, the card's controller must have at least 2 cards in hand and must be able
       to discard them.
409.4. When **Discarding** is part of an effect, then a player must **Discard** as many cards as possible from their
    hand. If instructed to discard more cards than they have in their hand, further discard instructions are
    ignored.
       _Example:_ Undercover Agent has the ability "[Deathknell] — Discard 2, then draw 2. (When I
       die, get the effect.)" If Undercover Agent's controller has 2 or more cards in hand, they must
       discard 2. If they have 1 card in hand, they discard 1, and the rest of the discard instruction is
       ignored. If they have no cards in hand, the entire discard instruction is ignored. Regardless of
       how many cards they discard, they then draw 2.
409.5. This action is formatted as "Discard X."


410. **Stun**
410.1. **Stunning** is the act of selecting one or more **Units** on **the Board** and rendering them **Stunned.**
410.1.a. **Stunned** is a binary state. A **Unit** is **Stunned** or it isn't.
410.1.a.1. A **Stunned Unit** can not be **Stunned** again.
    _Example:_ Eclipse Herald has the ability "When you stun an enemy unit,
    ready me and give me +1 [M] this turn." Its controller plays a spell that
    reads "Stun a unit." They may choose a unit that's already stunned, but if
    they do, Eclipse Herald will not trigger.
410.1.a.2. **Stunned Units** lose the **Stunned** status at the beginning of the next **Ending Step.**
410.1.b. A **Stunned Unit** does not contribute its might to damage in combat.
410.1.c. A **Stunned Unit** must still have damage applied to it equal to, or greater than, its full might
    value to be killed.
410.2. **Stunning** is a **Limited Action.**
410.2.a. Players may only **Stun Units** when directed to by **Game Effects.**
411. **Reveal**
411.1. **Revealing** is the act of presenting a card to _all players_ from a zone that one or more players do not
    have access to the information of.
411.1.a. **Revealed** is a temporary state and is not a zone.
411.1.a.1. Other cards, including the card being revealed, can reference the act of _being_
    **Revealed.**
411.1.a.2. Cards remain in the zone they are being **Revealed** from. _Example:_ If a card is being
    **Revealed** from the top of a player's **Main Deck** , it is still the top card of that player's
    **Main Deck.**
411.1.b. Unless otherwise described, **Revealed** cards do nothing else beyond become temporarily
    known information to _all players._
411.2. **Revealing** is a **Limited Action.**
411.2.a. Players may only **Reveal** cards from **Private** or **Secret** zones when instructed to do so by
    **Game Effects.**
411.2.b. During the course of a game of **Riftbound** , a player may choose to show **Private** information
    to one or more other players. This does not count as revealing and does not trigger any
    effects that trigger when cards are revealed.
411.3. This action is formatted as "Reveal cards from [zone]."
    _Example:_ "Reveal 2 cards from the top of your Main Deck" would be executed by taking the
    two cards from the top of your Main Deck, and then presenting them to all players to clearly
    read and understand at the table. Then, when all players have had a chance to understand
    the revealed information, return them to the top of the deck in the same order.
411.4. **Game Effects** can manipulate or modify the cards **Revealed** while they are **Revealed**
411.4.a. While cards are **Revealed** , those cards can be further manipulated, or accessed. They can
    even have their destination modified for when the **Reveal** ends.
       _Example:_ "Reveal 2 cards from the top of your Main Deck. Put one into your hand
       and Recycle the other" would be executed by taking the top two cards from your
       Main Deck to the table, and once every player present has had a chance to
       understand them you would make the selection of one of them to add to your
       hand. The one you did not select would then be **Recycled** to the bottom of the
       **Main Deck.**


412. **Counter**
412.1. **Countering** is the act of negating the execution, activation, or otherwise playing of a card by a player.
412.1.a. A card that is **Countered** does nothing and is then placed in the **Trash.**
412.1.b. A card that is **Countered** is not considered to have been played.
412.1.c. **Countering** does not refund any costs paid to play a card.
412.1.c.1. This includes additional costs.
412.2. Countering is a **Limited Action.**
412.2.a. Players may only **Counter** cards when directed to by **Game Effects.**
412.3. This action is formatted as " **Counter** [a card or ability on the chain]."
413. **Buff**
413.1. **Buffing** is the action of placing a **Buff** counter on a **Unit**.
    _See_ **_rule 701. Buffs_** _for more information._
413.1.a. A **Buff** is also an object.
413.1.b. To **Buff** a unit, place a **Buff Counter** on it if it does not have one already
413.1.b.1. If the unit already has a **Buff Counter** on it, it does not get another one.
413.1.c. Units with **Buff Counters** can still be chosen for actions that **Buff** units, but will _not_ be
    **Buffed** as part of the execution.
       _Example:_ A spell reads "Buff a unit. Then, if it was buffed this way, draw a card." It
       will place a buff counter on a unit that has no buff counter, and then its controller
       will draw a card. However, if the player chooses a unit with a buff counter on it
       already, then the card will not be drawn.
413.2. **Buffing** is a **Limited Action.**
413.2.a. Players may only **Buff** units when **Game Effects** direct them to do so.
413.3. This action is formatted as " **Buff** [one or more units]."
    _e.g.,_ "Buff a unit."
    _e.g.,_ "Buff a friendly unit."
    _e.g.,_ "Buff two friendly units at the same battlefield."
414. **Banish**
414.1. **Banishing** is the action of placing a card from any zone to **Banishment.**
    _See_ **_107.5. Banishment_** _for more information._
414.2. When a card is **Banished** it is placed directly into the **Banishment** zone from its origin.
414.2.a. Banish is not a subset of **Kill.**
414.2.b. Banish is not a subset of **Discard.**
414.3. Cards and effects can refer to cards that were banished _by the same object._
414.3.a. Separate instances of an object or effect banishing cards do not reference other banished
    cards by objects of the same name or effects originating from cards of the same name.
       _Example:_ A spell reads "Banish the top card of your Main Deck. When you conquer
       this turn, draw it." This card effect allows you to draw the banished card from
       banishment if a condition is met. If more than one of these effects is played, each
       one triggers separately. Each card will be drawn separately. If the turn player passes
       the turn without playing the card, the card remains in banishment indefinitely. If
       the same player plays another copy of the same spell, banishes another card, and


satisfies its condition, they could play the new banished card, but not the original
banished card.
414.4. **Banishing** is a **Limited Action.**
414.4.a. Players may only **Banish** cards or permanents when **Game Effects** direct them to do so.
414.5. This action is formatted as "Banish [one or more permanents or cards]."
_e.g.,_ "Banish a card from your hand."
_e.g.,_ "Banish 2 cards from your trash."
_e.g.,_ "Look at the top 2 cards of your Main Deck. Draw one of them and banish the other."

415. **Kill**
415.1. **Killing** is the action of a **Permanent** going to the trash from the board.
415.1.a. This can be **Active** or **Passive.**
415.1.a.1. **Active Kill** is when the action is taken when instructed by a game effect or as a cost
    for a card or ability.
415.1.a.2. **Passive Kill** is when the action is taken as a result of **Lethal Damage** or as a
    consequence for any other state.
415.2. When a **permanent** is **killed** it is placed directly in the trash from its place of origin.
415.2.a. It is only considered **Killed** if its origin was any zone on the board.
415.2.b. This is not a subset of **Move.**
415.3. **Killing** is a **Limited Action.**
415.3.a. Players may only **Kill** units when **Game Effects** direct them to do so.
415.4. **Killing** can also be the result of resolving a **Cleanup.**
415.5. **Killing** can be attributed to one or more **Game Objects.**
415.5.a. The Killed **Unit** or **Gear** is said to be **Killed** by that **Game Object.**
415.5.b. A spell or ability that contains a **Kill** instruction is responsible for **Killing** the **Unit** or **Gear.**
415.5.c. When one or more **Units** is killed due to a **Cleanup** , the spell or ability that resolved
    immediately prior to that **Cleanup** that applied damage to the **Unit** or **Units** is responsible
    for that **Kill** action.
415.5.d. **Abilities** originating from **Game Objects** that are responsible for **Kill Actions** are responsible
    in addition to the **Game Object** that created them.
       _Example:_ Falling Star is a spell that says “Do this twice: Deal 3 to a unit.” Immortal
       Phoenix is a unit that says “When you kill a unit with a spell, you may pay [1][C] to
       play me from your trash.” A player plays Falling Star while Immortal Phoenix is in
       their trash. The “do this” phrasing on Falling Star means that it has a reflexive
       triggered ability, which places two triggered abilities on the chain. As each of those
       triggered abilities resolve, it deals damage to the unit chosen for that ability. If one
       of these abilities deals lethal damage to a unit, both Falling Star and its ability are
       considered sources of the damage, and so both Falling Star and its ability are
       responsible for killing the unit. This means that Falling Star’s controller killed a unit
       with a spell, so Immortal Phoenix’s ability will trigger.
415.6. This action is formatted as "Kill [one or more permanents]."
    _e.g.,_ "Kill an enemy unit."
    _e.g.,_ "Kill this, [2]: Draw 1."
    _e.g.,_ "Kill all gear."
416. **Add**


416.1. **Adding** is the action of putting resources into a player's **Rune Pool.**
416.2. Spells, triggered abilities, and activated abilities that **Add** resources finalize immediately.
416.2.a. **Priority** and **Focus** will not pass from **Add** abilities being finalized, and will resolve before any
other outstanding items on the chain are finalized.
416.3. Activated abilities that **Add** resources and have the **Reaction** tag can be activated during the playing
or resolution of other spells and abilities, any time that those spells or abilities require that resources
be paid.
_Example:_ A player can add Energy and Power through any means before initiating the
process of playing a spell. After initiating that process, in the Pay Costs step, they may
activate **Add Reactions** to add Energy or Power to pay costs.
416.4. **Adding** is a **Limited Action.**
416.4.a. Players may only **Add** resources when **Game Effects** direct them to do so.
416.5. This action is formatted as "Add [one or more resources]."
_e.g.,_ "Add [2]." means "Add 2 Energy."
_e.g.,_ "[E]: Add [Y]." means "Add 1 Power of the Order domain."
_e.g.,_ "Add [1][G]." means "Add 1 Energy and 1 Power of the Calm domain."

417. **Channel**
417.1. **Channeling** is the action of taking one or more **Runes** from the top of a player's **Rune Deck** and
    putting them on the board.
417.2. The **Game Effect** that instructs a player to channel 1 or more runes may specify the conditions or
    circumstances under which those runes enter the board. _Example:_ A spell reads "Channel 1 rune
    exhausted." As that spell resolves, its controller puts the top rune of their rune deck onto the board
    and that rune enters the board exhausted rather than ready.
417.3. **Channeling** is a **Limited Action.**
417.3.a. Players may only channel runes when **Game Effects** direct them to do so.
417.4. This action is formatted as "Channel X rune(s)," optionally followed by conditions or stipulations.
    _e.g.,_ "Channel 1 rune."
    _e.g.,_ "When you play me, channel 1 rune exhausted."
    _e.g.,_ "Channel 2 runes exhausted. If you couldn't channel 2 runes this way, draw 1."
418. **Burn Out**
418.1. **Burning Out** is an action a player must perform if they attempt to move one or more cards from their
    **Main Deck** to any other zone in excess of the number of cards remaining in their **Main Deck:**
418.1.a. If a player must **Draw** cards in excess to the number of cards in their deck, they will **Draw** as
    many as possible, perform this action, then **Draw** the remaining amount instructed.
418.1.b. If a player must put one or more cards from their **Main Deck** in any other zone, such as the
    **Trash** , in excess of the number of cards in their deck they will do so as much as possible,
    perform this action, and then complete the remaining number required by the instruction.
418.1.c. If an instruction directs a player to look at or reveal cards in excess to the number of cards in
    a player’s **Main Deck** , that player looks at or **Reveals** as many as possible, but does not **Burn**
    **Out,** then proceeds with the rest of the instruction.
418.1.c.1. If there are insufficient cards among the looked at or revealed cards to perform
    subsequent actions to the revealed or looked at cards, any further instructions are
    ignored. This does not cause a **Burn Out** , even if those instructions would cause
    those cards to change zones.
       _Reminder:_ Cards are considered in the zone of origin while being looked at
       or revealed, in this case the **Main Deck**.


418.2. To **Burn Out** , a player does the following in sequence:
418.2.a. Performs as much of the prescribed action as possible.
418.2.b. Recycles their trash into their Main Deck.
_Reminder:_ When multiple cards are **Recycled** to the **Main Deck** at the same time,
those cards must be randomized
418.2.c. Chooses an opponent to gain 1 point.
418.2.d. Completes the remainder of the action that caused them to burn out.
_Example:_ A player attempts to draw 1 during their Draw Phase while their Main
Deck is empty. That player instead recycles their trash into their Main Deck,
randomizing it as normal, then chooses an opponent to gain 1 point, and then
draws 1.
418.3. A player's Main Deck may remain empty as they **Burn Out** , usually because their trash is also empty.
When they attempt to perform the original action again, it will cause another **Burn Out**.
418.3.a. Unless some effect intervenes, this will result in them burning out repeatedly, giving 1 point
to an opponent each time, until an opponent passes the Victory Score and wins the game.
418.4. **Burning Out** is a **Limited Action.**
418.4.a. Players may only burn out when **Game Effects** direct them to do so.
418.5. **Burning Out** is a **Replacement Effect.**
_See_ **_rule 364. Replacement Effects_** _for more information._

### 419. Movement

420. **Moving** is a **Limited Action.**
420.1. A **Permanent** changing its position from any space on **the Board** to another space on **the Board** is a
    **Move** , unless it is caused by a corrective **Recall**.
       _See_ **_rule 407. Move_** _for more information._
420.2. A card changing game zones does not in itself constitute a **Move.**
420.3. **Moving** is instantaneous.
420.3.a. There is no state for **Permanents** between locations.
420.3.b. **Permanents** are either at their **Origin** before **Moving** or their **Destination** after **Moving.**
420.3.c. **Moving** does not use the **Chain** , nor is it able to be **Reacted** to.
421. **Moving** is defined by the **Origin** and **Destination** of the **Permanent** that is changing locations.
421.1. The **Origin** is where the **Permanent** is starting from.
421.2. The **Destination** is where the **Permanent** is going to.
421.2.a. In **Modes of Play** with more than two players, **Battlefields** with **Staged Combats** or
    **Combats in Progress** are **Invalid Destinations** for **Moves** of all kinds ( **Standard Moves** or
    otherwise) by **Units** controlled by **Players** who don't already have permanents at that
    **Battlefield**.
421.2.b. If an action would _require_ a **Move** that would cause a **Unit** to become present in a **Location**
    where it cannot move for any reason, such as a **Battlefield** with two players that are **_not_** the
    controller of the **Unit** performing this **Move** action are in a **Combat** or such a **Combat** is
    **Staged** , it instead **_Recalls._**
       _See_ **_rule 428. Recalls_** _for more information._
421.3. **Units** are the only **Permanents** that can **Move.**


422. Players may choose to move their **Units** with the **Standard Move.**
    _See_ **_rule 140._** _for more information on the_ **_Standard Move._**
423. **Spells** , **Abilities** , or other effects may cause a **Move** to occur.
423.1. The source of the **Move** will provide details on any restrictions on legality for **Destination.**
423.2. **Units** **_cannot_** **Move** to a **Battlefield** that already has units from 2 other players present by any means.
424. The **Destination** becomes **Contested** if it is a **Battlefield** not controlled by the controller of the **Unit** or **Units**
    that moved.
425. **Units** may cause a **Showdown** without a **Combat** when they **Move.**
425.1. A **Showdown** is opened when a **Move** causes a **Battlefield** to become **Contested** while it has no
    **Units** present from any player other than those that just moved.
426. **Units** may cause **Combat** when they **Move.**
426.1. A **Combat** is triggered when a **Move** causes a **Battlefield** to become **Contested** and **Units** controlled
    by opposing players.
       _See_ **_rule 433. Combat_** _for more information._
427. When a **Move** action is complete, perform a **Cleanup.**
428. Recalls
429. A **Recall** is when a **Permanent** is relocated from anywhere to its **Base** without it being a **Move.**
430. **Recalls** are not **Moves.**
430.1. They do not cause **Triggered Abilities** to trigger that are triggered by **Move** actions.
430.2. A **Recall** causes a **Permanent** to change locations.
430.3. A **Recall** cannot be prevented by actions and **Game Effects** that restrict or block **Movement.**
431. Gear can be **Recalled.**
431.1. When **Gear** is created or played at a battlefield, or is at a battlefield for any other reason, it is **Recalled**
    to its controller's base during the next **Cleanup.**
       _Example:_ Zhonya's Hourglass is a gear with the **Hidden** ability, which allows it to be hidden
       at a battlefield and played later to that battlefield. If Zhonya's Hourglass is played from
       hidden, it must be played to that battlefield. It will be recalled to its controller's base during
       the next **Cleanup.**
432. Recalls do not affect the state of the **Permanent** being recalled.
432.1. Unless otherwise stated by the source of the **Recall** , Damage, Exhausted Status, Buffed Status, and
    applied Layer alterations will all remain unaffected by a **Recall**.

### 433. Combat

434. A **Combat** occurs when a **Cleanup** occurs, there are no items on the **Chain** , and a **Battlefield** has **Units**
    controlled by **two** opposing players.
435. **Combat** is considered **Staged** if there are units controlled by two opposing players at a **Battlefield** but the
    **Steps of Combat** have not been initiated.
435.1. If more than one **Battlefield** has **Units** controlled by opposing players at it at the same time, the **Turn**
    **Player** decides which **Combat** to resolve first.
435.2. If **Staged Combats** stop being **Staged** before the **Steps of Combat** are initiated, they are not resolved
    or executed.


436. **Combat** can only occur between **Units** controlled by exactly two players.
436.1. In **Modes of Play** with more than two players, **Battlefields** with **Staged Combats** or **Combats in**
    **Progress** are **Invalid Destinations** for **Moves** of all kinds ( **Standard Moves** or otherwise) by **Units**
    controlled by **Players** who don't already have permanents at that **Battlefield.**
       _See_ **_rule 421.2.a._** _for more information on_ **_Invalid Destinations._**
436.2. In **Modes of Play** with more than two players, **Battlefields** with **Staged Combats** or **Combats in**
    **Progress** are **Invalid** to be chosen as a location to play one or more **Units** by a player not involved in
    that **Combat** by any means
436.2.a. If an effect would _require_ a **Unit** be played to a **Battlefield** with a **Staged Combat** or a
    **Combat in Progress** , where the controller of the played unit is not a participant, instead the
    **Unit** is played to its controller's **Base.**
436.2.b. Any subsequent reference to "here" in the corresponding effect is reassigned to the
    Controller's **Base** , where the **Unit** was played. Any further effects that may be invalidated are
    invalidated as if the effect was mistargeted.
       _See_ **_rule 352.5. Targeting_** _for more information on_ **_Mistargeting._**
436.3. All choices that would result in a **Combat** occurring between more than two players simultaneously
    are invalid and ineligible to be completed.

### 437. The Steps of Combat

438. **Step 1: The Showdown Step**
438.1. A **Showdown** opens at this time.
438.1.a. Establish who is **Attacker** and who is **Defender.**
438.1.a.1. The **Attacker** is the player whose unit(s) applied the **Contested** status to the
    **Battlefield.** They gain the **Attacker designation** now.
438.1.a.1.a. This player gains Focus as this Showdown begins.
438.1.a.2. The **Defender** is the player who did not apply the **Contested** status to the
    **Battlefield.** They gain the **Defender** designation now.
438.1.a.3. Units at the **Contested Battlefield** controlled by the **Attacker** gain the **Attacker**
    designation now.
438.1.a.3.a. If a **Unit** controlled by the **Attacker** becomes present at this **Battlefield**
    after this moment, it will gain the **Attacker** designation during the
    **Cleanup** phase following the action that caused it to become present
438.1.a.4. Units at the **Contested Battlefield** controlled by the **Defender** gain the **Defender**
    designation now.
438.1.a.4.a. If a **Unit** controlled by the **Defender** becomes present at this **Battlefield**
    after this moment it will gain the **Defender** designation during the
    **Cleanup** phase following the action that caused it to become present
438.1.b. Finalize items on the **Initial Chain** if establishing **Attacker** and **Defender** has caused
    **Triggered Abilities** to become **Pending.**
438.1.b.1. The **Attacking** player, who has **Focus** , places **Triggered Abilities** on the Chain first,
    followed by all non- **Defender** players in **Turn Order** , followed by the **Defending**
    **Player.**
438.1.c. The **State Closes** if an **Initial Chain** was created.
438.1.c.1. Otherwise the **Showdown** continues, with the **State Open** as normal.
438.1.d. Players proceed with any play on the **Chain** as normal.


438.1.e. Focus does not pass upon closure of the Initial Chain, if any.

439. **Step 2: The Combat Damage Step**
439.1. When the **Showdown** closes, **Attackers** and **Defenders** resolve **Combat Damage** at the **Battlefield**
    that was attacked, using their current **Might.**
439.1.a. **The Combat Damage Step** only occurs if both **Attacking** and **Defending** units remain at
    the location.
439.1.a.1. If neither **Attacking Units** nor **Defending Units** remain at this stage, the **Combat**
    **Damage Step** is skipped.
439.1.b. Sum the **Might** of all **Attacking Units.**
439.1.c. Sum the **Might** of all **Defending Units.**
439.1.d. Starting with the **Attacker** , each player assigns an amount of damage equal to their
    summed **Might** among the other's **Units.**
439.1.d.1. Assigning **Damage** is not **Dealing Damage.**
439.1.d.1.a. When all **Damage** is assigned, it will be **Dealt** simultaneously. These
    actions are not synonymous.
439.1.d.2. Abilities or effects may influence the order in which damage is assigned. **Reminder:**
    **Lethal Damage is non-zero damage equaling or exceeding the Might of a Unit.**
439.1.d.3. **Units** must have lethal damage assigned to them in full before damage is assigned
    to a different **Unit.**
       _Example:_ If a player has 5 damage to distribute among four 3 Might units,
       they may _not_ choose to assign 2 damage to one of the units and 1 damage
       to each of the remaining 3. They must assign at least 3 damage to one,
       and the remaining 2 to another.
439.1.d.4. **Units** cannot have more damage assigned to them than the minimum required to
    constitute lethal damage unless no further units remain to have damage assigned
    to them.
439.1.d.5. A player must obey all requirements and restrictions on damage assignment if
    able.
       _Example:_ A player is assigning damage to the following units: a unit with
       **Tank** ("I must be assigned combat damage first."); Caitlyn, Patrolling ("I
       must be assigned combat damage last."); and another unit without any
       abilities. That player must assign combat damage first to the unit with
       Tank, then to the unit with no abilities, then to Caitlyn.
439.1.d.6. If multiple **Units** have abilities or effects that require a player to assign them
    damage with the same priority, that player may assign damage to those units in
    any order.
       _Example:_ A player is assigning damage to the following units: two units
       with **Tank** ("I must be assigned combat damage first.") and one unit with
       no abilities. That player chooses one of the units with Tank and assigns
       combat damage to it. Then they must assign any remaining damage first
       to the other unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities.
439.1.d.7. If a **Unit** has one or more **Abilities** or effects applying to it that demand it be
    assigned damage in a specific way that is exclusionary, then the assigning player
    chooses only one of those abilities to apply when assigning damage.
       _Example:_ Caitlyn, Patrolling ("I must be assigned combat damage last.")
       has been given the Tank ability ("I must be assigned combat damage
       first."). A player is assigning damage to this Caitlyn with Tank and two units
       with no abilities. That player can’t fulfill both of Caitlyn’s damage
       requirements, so they may choose to assign damage to Caitlyn first,
       fulfilling the Tank requirement, or last, fulfilling Caitlyn’s printed


requirement. They can’t choose to apply damage to Caitlyn in between the
other two units, because that wouldn’t fulfill either requirement.
439.1.d.8. If there is more than one unit in which this situation applies to, each unit is dealt
with individually. The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and
then resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one
unit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage
in any order as normal within that priority.
_Example: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling ("I must be assigned combat
damage last.") have been given the Tank ability ("I must be assigned
combat damage first."). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns
and one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns’ Tank
requirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit._
439.1.d.9. If a unit cannot be dealt damage, then no amount of damage can be considered
lethal. Such a unit is exempt from any considerations of mandatory assignment.
_Example: Kayn, Unleashed says “If I have moved twice this turn, I don't
take damage.” While Kayn can’t take damage, it is ignored for the
purposes of assigning lethal damage in combat._
439.1.e. Deal **Damage** to each unit equal to the amount assigned to it.

440. **Step 3: The Resolution Step**
440.1. 1. Perform a **Combat Cleanup.**
440.1.a. Invoke a **Special Cleanup.**
440.1.a.1. Insert “2a. Clear all marked damage from all **Units.** ”
440.1.a.2. Insert “2b. Recall Attackers present at the **Battlefield** if **Defenders** are still present.”
    _See_ **_rule 428. Recalls_** _for more information._
440.1.a.3. Insert “2c. Remove Attacker and Defender Designation from all **Units** and **Players.** ”
440.1.b. Clear the **Contested** status from this **Battlefield**_._
440.1.b.1. Clear the **Contested** status regardless of the outcome of the **Combat.**
440.2. If any **Units** remain at the **Battlefield** , and if their controller does not already **Control** the **Battlefield** ,
    that player **Establishes Control** over the **Battlefield.**.
440.2.a. This results in a **Conquer** if that player has not yet scored that **Battlefield** this turn.
    _See_ **_rule 179. Control_** _for more information on_ **_Control._**
_See_ **_rule 442.1._** _for more information on_ **_Conquering._**
440.2.b. This does not have to be the player that applied **Contested** to the **Battlefield.**

### 441. Scoring

442. A player **Scores** in one of two ways:
442.1. **Conquer:** A player gains **Control** of a **Battlefield** they did not yet **Score** this turn.
442.1.a. In **Modes of Play** with teammates, **Battlefields** under the **Control** of a teammate during the
    **Beginning Phase** are also disqualified from being **Scored** through **Conquer** by any means.
442.1.b. A player will gain control of a **Battlefield** after establishing **Control** by applying **Contested**
    first.
442.2. **Hold:** A player maintains **Control** of a **Battlefield** during their **Beginning Phase.**
443. A player may only **Score** , from either method, once per **Battlefield** per turn.
444. When a player **Scores** , two things occur:


444.1. The player earns up to one **Point** , depending on their current score.
444.1.a. The **Final Point** has additional restrictions.
444.1.a.1. Notably, points earned from sources that are not **Conquer** or **Hold** are not beholden
to these restrictions.
444.1.b. When a player tries to earn a **Point** through a **Score** , and their current **Point Total** is 1 point
from the **Victory Score** of the **Mode of Play** , the following occurs:
444.1.b.1. If the player has **Scored** through **Hold** , that player scores the **Final Point.**
444.1.b.2. If the player has **Scored** through a **Conquer** and has **Scored** every **Battlefield**
through either method this turn, that player scores the **Final Point**. If the player has
**Scored** through a **Conquer** and has _not_ **Scored** every **Battlefield** this turn, that
player draws a card.
444.2. Trigger **Score abilities** at the **Battlefield** that **Scored.**
444.2.a. **Conquer abilities** trigger at a **Battlefield** that was **Conquered.**
444.2.b. **Hold abilities** trigger at a **Battlefield** that was **Held.**
444.2.c. These will only trigger when the **Battlefield** is **Scored;** I.E. These cannot be triggered more
than once per turn for a player.

445. When a player accrues **Points** equal to the **Victory Score** for their **Mode of Play** , they **Win the Game**
    immediately.

### 446. Layers

447. Layers are the mechanism in which **Game Effects** alter the Traits, Intrinsic Abilities, or other properties of
    **Game Objects.**
448. Layers are an organizational structure.
448.1. Layers only serve to structure the application and order that **Game Effects** apply to **Game Objects** to
    maintain consistency.
449. The layers are applied **repeatedly** until **all effects operating on objects have been applied once** and **no**
    **changes have been processed.**
449.1. Layers are applied in sequence. Each effect in them is applied as soon as able, and only a single time
    across all sequences.
449.2. When a sequence of applications completes, recur the process, and evaluate each layer again
    applying any effects that may now be applicable.
449.3. The removal or disqualification of an effect is separate from the application of the effect, but still can
    only be applied once.
       _Example:_ Fiora, Victorious has printed Might 4 and says “While I'm Mighty, I have Deflect,
       Ganking, and Shield.” If a player places a buff on Fiora, her Might is increased in the
       Arithmetic layer, after the layer for Ability-Altering Effects. The Ability-Altering Effect layer is
       then re-checked and the abilities Deflect, Ganking, and Shield applied. Since each effect has
       been applied once and there are no other effects to apply, Fiora’s characteristics are finalized
       as 5 Might with Deflect, Ganking, and Shield. While a buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as
       a defender, an additional +1 Might will be applied in the Arithmetic layer, giving her 6 Might
       and the 3 keywords.
       _Example:_ A buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender when her buff is removed.
       Reevaluating the layers in sequence, she no longer gains Deflect, Ganking, and Shield
       during the Ability-Altering Effect layer, so when the Arithmetic layer is evaluated, neither the
       buff (which is gone) nor Shield (which she no longer has) apply. She goes directly from 6
       Might with three keywords to 4 Might with no keywords..


450. Layers are applied in the following order:
450.1. 1. Trait-Altering Effects
450.1.a. This layer deals with effects that grant, remove, or replace inherent traits of **Game Objects.**
    Name
    Super Type
    Type
    Tags
    Controller
    Cost
    Domain
450.1.a.1. Assignment of Might is dealt with in this layer.
    _Example:_ A spell reads "A unit's Might becomes 4 this turn." The unit's
    Might is set to 4 in this layer.
450.1.b. One **Game Object** becoming a copy of another.
450.1.b.1. All Traits, including the Rules Text, replace or are added to those of the original
    **Game Object** as specified by the **Game Effect** directing the Copy. This is applied in
    this layer.
450.1.c. Effects for this layer can be identified by the phrase "become(s)", "give," "is," or "are" in the
    text.
       _Example:_ A permanent has the ability "Other friendly units are Yordles." Other
       friendly units gain the Yordle tag in this layer.
450.2. 2. Ability-Altering Effects
450.2.a. This layer deals with effects that grant, remove, or replace the abilities or rules text of **Game**
    **Objects**.
       Keywords
       Passive Abilitie
       Appending rules text
       Removing rules text
       Duplicating Rules Text from one **Game Object** to another
450.2.b. Effects for this layer can be identified by the phrase "become(s)," "give," "lose(s)," "have," "has,"
    "is," or "are" in the text.
       _Example:_ A permanent has the ability "Other friendly units have [Vision]." Other
       friendly units gain the **Vision** keyword in this layer.
450.3. 3. Arithmetic
450.3.a. This layer deals with the mathematics of increasing and decreasing the numeric values of
    the traits of **Game Objects.**
       Might
       Energy Cost
       Power Cost
450.3.b. When an arithmetic effect has a limitation that applies, it is limited at the time of its
    application, and is “remembered” at that limited level for the duration of its effect. This
    process is called “snapshotting.”
       _Example:_ If an effect gives a unit “-4 [M] to a min of 1 until end of turn” choosing a
       unit with 2 [M], then the effect will generate -1 [M] until end of turn.
450.3.c. This layer applies arithmetic in the following way.
450.3.c.1. 1. Increases
450.3.d.1. Positive values, or increases, to Might are applied first.
450.3.e.1. If there is a restriction or limitation to this increase, the limitation is
    “snapshotted” for the duration of the effect.


450.3.e.2. 2. Decreases
450.3.f.0.a. Negative values, or decreases, to Might are applied last.
450.3.g.1. If there is a restriction or limitation to this decrease, the limitation is
snapshotted for the duration of the effect.

451. If more than one effect applies to the same **Game Object** in the **Same Layer** , or to each other in the same
    layer, then both effects will apply but their order may be determined by **Dependency.**
451.1. A **Dependency** is established if:
451.1.a. Applying one of the effects alters the existence of the other; or
451.1.b. Applying one of the effects alters the number of objects the other effect can influence
451.1.c. Applying one of the effects alters the outcome when applying the other non-
    deterministically
452. To determine which effect **Depends on** another, determine which of the prior criteria applies, and then also
    which effect’s evaluation is altered by the sequence of applications. That effect is said to **Depend on** the other.
452.1. To resolve a dependency, the effects within the same layer that created the dependency must be
    applied such that:
       1. Identify which effect **Depends on** the other within the Layer.
       2. Apply the effect that is depended on first.
       3. Immediately apply the effect that Depends on the first effect next.
453. If more than one effect applies in the same layer but no dependency is established, then **Timestamp** order is
    applied to the effects.
453.1. The first effect to have been played is applied first, and the newest effect is applied last within the
    same **Layer.**

### 454. Modes of Play

455. There are multiple methods of playing **Riftbound.**
456. A **Mode of Play** must define several variables for the game.
456.1. **Number of Players** : How many people are playing the game.
456.2. **Formation of Players** : How the players are organized while playing.
456.2.a. This defines if a player is alone or on a team.
456.2.b. This defines the number of opponents.
456.3. **Victory Score:** The point total a player or team must reach to win.
456.3.a. **Victory Scores** can be any positive number.
456.4. **Battlefield Count:** Determines how many **Battlefields** are in play, contributed by players, during play.
456.4.a. This may influence deck building requirements in competitive settings.
456.4.b. This may involve utilizing less **Battlefields** than there are players.
456.5. **Setup:** Any changes to initial setup required for this mode.
456.6. **Format:** Conditions to win or additional rules added over play.
456.7. **First Turn Process:** Adjustments to each player's first turn.

### 649. Conceding

650. A player may concede at any time.
651. When a player concedes, they are removed from the game in progress.
651.1. If only one other player is remaining after a player has conceded, the player remaining **Wins.**


651.2. If more than one player remains after a concession, follow the steps for the **Removal of a Player.**
651.3. Removal of a player involves them no longer being able to make choices or otherwise influence the
game.
651.4. If the player has **Teammates** due to the **Mode of Play** , that player’s **Teammates** also lose and are
removed from the game.

652. If the game continues, follow these steps for **Removal of a Player.**
652.1. **Banish** all permanents and runes they currently control and all permanents and runes they own.
652.2. Remove the **Battlefield** they contributed to the game if it is in use.
652.2.a. If it was in use, replace it with a token battlefield with no abilities.
652.2.b. Any units or hidden cards there do not move and are otherwise unaffected by this process.
652.2.c. If the removed battlefield was applying any continuous effects, those continuous effects
    immediately cease, which may cause changes in the characteristics of units or hidden cards
    there.
       _Example:_ A battlefield reads "Units here have +1 [M]." If that battlefield's owner
       concedes and the battlefield is removed from the game as a result, units there
       immediately cease to get +1 [M].
652.3. Remove all cards they own from the game.
652.4. **Counter** all spells and abilities of all types controlled by the player that has conceded.
652.5. Proceed with the game.

652.5.a.1. If the removed player was the **Turn Player** , play proceeds in **Turn Order** to the next
    available player in order.
652.5.b. Focus
652.5.b.1. If the removed player had **Focus** in a **Showdown** , the next **Player** in order receives
    **Focus**.
652.5.b.2. If the player being removed creates a state where all **Players** have **Passed** their
    **Focus** , the **Showdown** ends and play proceeds as necessary, E.G. **Combat** is
    resolved or a **Cleanup** is completed.
652.5.c. Priority
652.5.c.1. If the removed player had **Priority** during a **Chain** , the next **Player** in order receives
    **Priority**.
652.5.c.2. If the player being removed creates a state where all **Players** have passed **Priority** ,
    then the most recent spell or ability on the **Chain** will resolve with **Priority** being
    re-established as appropriate for the state after the resolution of that spell or ability.

## 700. Additional Rules

### 701. Buffs

702. **Buffs** are objects placed on **Units.**
702.1. **Buffs** can be tracked with a buff reminder card from a **Riftbound** booster pack or with any spare
    object in your surroundings.


702.2. **Buffs** can be added or spent.
702.2.a. To **Buff** a **Unit** , a player chooses a **Unit** and then places a buff on it. That **Unit** is **Buffed** for as
long as the buff remains on it.
702.2.b. **Spending** a **Buff** removes a single **Buff** counter from a **Unit**.
702.2.b.1. A buff cannot be spent from a **Unit** that does not have a buff.
702.2.b.2. A player can only spend buffs on units they control.
702.3. There can only be one **Buff** on a **Unit** at a time.
702.3.a. If a **Buff** is added, or instructed to be added, on a **Unit** that already has a **Buff** , it is _not_ placed
instead.

703. Each **Buff** individually contributes +1 **Might** to a **Unit.**
704. **Buffs** are **Game Objects** and may be referenced, counted, or targeted by other effects as specified.
705. If a **Unit** leaves play, remove all **Buffs** from it.
705.1. **Champions** do not retain **Buffs** in the Champion Zone, even if they return there somehow.

### 706. Mighty

707. **Mighty** is a description that applies to some units. Other game effects can check whether a unit is **Mighty.**
708. A **Unit** "is Mighty" as long as its Might is 5 or greater.
709. A **Unit** "becomes Mighty" at the moment its Might changes from being less than 5 to being 5 or greater.
    _Example:_ A Unit with Might 4 that gets +1 [M] becomes **Mighty**.
    _Example:_ A Unit with Might 5 that gets +1 [M] does _not_ become **Mighty** , because it was already
    **Mighty.**
710. Units on the board are evaluated according to their current Might.
    _Example:_ A unit with a base Might of 3 is targeted by a spell that reads "A unit gets +3 [M] this turn." As
    that spell resolves, its Might changes from 3 to 6, and it becomes **Mighty**. When that effect expires at
    the end of the turn, it will no longer be **Mighty.**
711. Units in **Non-Board Zones** are evaluated according to their inherent Might.
    _Example:_ A unit in the trash is **Mighty** if its printed Might is 5 or greater. It doesn't matter if there were
    effects raising or lowering its might while it was on the board.

### 712. Bonus Damage

713. **Bonus Damage** is an intrinsic property that can be granted to **Deal** actions that influence the amount of
    **Damage** that the action is distributing.
714. If more than one instance of **Bonus Damage** is applied or granted to a **Deal** action, all instances are summed
    and applied once.
714.1. Bonus Damage can only be a positive value, and can only increase the amount of **Damage** being
    distributed.
714.2. If, for any reason, **Bonus Damage** would be a negative number, then no **Bonus Damage** is applied to
    the action.
715. Bonus Damage applies to the total damage **Dealt** by one instance of the action.
715.1. If the **Deal** action has a single target, the amount of **Damage** to that target will be increased by the
    **Bonus Damage** granted to it.


715.2. If the **Deal** action has multiple targets, the amount of **Damage** dealt to each target is increased by
**Bonus Damage** individually and separately.
_Example:_ Singularity is a spell that says “Deal 6 to each of up to two units.” A player plays
Singularity while they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says “Your spells and abilities deal 1
Bonus Damage.” Singularity deals 1 Bonus Damage to both of its targets, dealing 7 to each.
715.3. If the **Deal** action **Splits** damage, then the **Bonus Damage** applies to the amount of **Damage** that
will be **Split**. This can alter the number of targets eligible to be chosen.
_Example:_ Volibear, Furious is a unit that says in part “When I attack, deal 5 damage split
among any number of enemy units here.” A player attacks with Volibear, Furious while they
also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says “Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus Damage.”
Volibear, Furious now deals 6 damage split among any number of enemy units at its
location, and can choose to split that damage among up to 6 units rather than the usual 5.

    **Keyword** is granted while it is already present.
717.3.a.2. The effect that granted the **Keyword** will specify the duration for which it is
    granted.
717.3.a.3. If an effect that grants a **Keyword** does not specify a duration, the duration is as
    long as that **Game Object** remains on **the Board** or in its current **Non-Board Zone.**
717.3.b. Other effects may remove **Keywords.**
717.3.b.1. The effect that removed the **Keyword** will specify the duration it is removed.

    battlefield. Beginning on the next turn, this gains [Reaction] and you may play this, ignoring
    its base cost."
727.1.c. It allows the player to take the Discretionary Action **Hide**.
727.1.c.1. Hide is not a subset of **Play**.

727.1.c.3. Playing a card from facedown (or "from Hidden") does open a chain.
727.1.d. Some choices made while playing a card from Hidden are restricted to the battlefield where
    it was hidden. A card cannot be played from Hidden if it is a spell with no valid targets under
    these restrictions.
       _See_ **_rule 352.5. Targeting_** _for more information._
727.1.d.1. A hidden unit must be played to that battlefield.


727.1.d.2. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent chooses any targets, those
targets must be chosen from among options at that battlefield, unless the ability
explicitly restricts targeting in a way that makes this impossible.
_Example:_ Blastcone Fae is a unit with Hidden and “When you play me,
give a unit -2 [M] this turn, to a minimum of 1 [M].” Because this is a play
effect, its target must be chosen from among units at the same battlefield
if Blastcone Fae was played from Hidden.
_Example:_ Tideturner is a unit with Hidden and “When you play me, you
may choose a unit you control at another location. Move me to its location
and it to my original location.” Because its play ability has a targeting
restriction that can never be fulfilled by a unit at its battlefield, its target
may be chosen freely from among the available options.
727.1.d.3. If a hidden spell or a play effect of a hidden permanent causes you to play a unit,
you must choose to play that unit at that battlefield.
727.2. Abilities and instructions of hidden cards other than the choices listed above function as normal.
_Example:_ Stand United is a spell that has Hidden and says “Buff a friendly unit. Buffs give an
additional +1 might to friendly units this turn.” If it’s played from Hidden, the first part of its
ability must choose a friendly unit at the same battlefield, but the second part of its ability
affects all friendly units with buffs, no matter where they are.
727.3. Instead of being hidden, a card with Hidden may be played for its cost as normal, at its normal timing
with no restrictions on targeting.
727.4. Multiple instances of Hidden are redundant.
727.5. Hidden, and whether or not a card has Hidden, is a characteristic of the card and may be checked or
referenced by other **Game Effects.**
727.5.a. This is independent of the state of being facedown.
727.6. A card that is **Hidden** gains **Reaction** while facedown, and may be played any time a card with
**Reaction** may be played as a result.
727.6.a. The property is granted to the card in its facedown state, and is not publicly known.

728. **Legion**
728.1. Legion is a **Conditional Keyword.**
728.1.a. It can be present on **Spells, Units, Rune Abilities, Legend Abilities** and **Permanent**

728.1.c. Starting from the Keyword to the end of the clause, the entire statement is the Legion
    Ability.
728.1.c.1. On spells and on play effects of permanents, it is functionally short for “If you have
    played another Main Deck card before this one already this turn, apply [Text].”
728.1.c.2. On other abilities and instructions, it is functionally short for “If you have played a
    Main Deck card this turn, apply [Text].”
728.1.c.3. This is called the Legion condition.
728.1.c.4. Legion's conditional can apply to passive abilities, activated abilities, spell
    instructions, or even abilities active in zones outside of the board.
728.2. All instances of Legion on cards a player controls are satisfied by that player playing a single card.
    _Example:_ One card has three different Legion Abilities. The Legion Text of all three abilities
    apply as long as one card has been played by the card's controller earlier in the same turn.


728.3. Legion, and whether or not a card has Legion, is a characteristic of the card and may be checked or
referenced by other **Game Effects.**

    **States** on any player's turn."
729.2. The corresponding card or effect with this keyword is not restricted to **Closed States** or **Showdowns**.
    This permission is inclusive of all other timings and options available to the ability as written, Action's
    permissions, or by default.
729.3. Reaction does not alter the function of any instruction of the Card, Rune, or Effect it is on. It is _only_
    Permission.
729.3.a. Playing **Units** with Reaction still has the inherent restrictions of playing **Units** without
    Reaction. It can only be played to the controlling player's base or a battlefield they control.
729.4. Reaction is a referencable characteristic.
729.4.a. Whether or not a **Game Object** has Reaction is a characteristic of that **Game Object** and
    may be checked or referenced by other **Game Effects.**
729.4.b. Whether or not a **Spell** has Reaction is a characteristic of that **Spell** and may be checked or
    referenced by other **Game Effects.**

730.2. If a Unit has Shield, or has been granted Shield, and is granted Shield by an additional source, the
    Shield Value of all granted Shield keywords is summed.

731.1.c.1. Players must still assign lethal damage to a unit before moving to the next when
    assigning their damage.
731.1.c.2. If more than one unit with Tank is present with the same controller in Combat,
    damage may be assigned to any of them. Units without Tank are invalid
    assignments until all units with Tank have lethal damage assigned to them.
